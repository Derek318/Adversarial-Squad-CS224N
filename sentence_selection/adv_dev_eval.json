{"1319":{"context":"The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test. After the Gemini 4 testing, a further 8 unmanned tests were cancelled due to the Titan cellpadding being insufficient to hold men safely.","question":"What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing, after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,20],[21,27],[28,30],[31,34],[35,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,61],[62,64],[65,67],[68,71],[71,72],[72,78],[79,82],[83,85],[86,89],[90,96],[97,99],[100,106],[107,108],[109,110],[110,116],[116,117],[118,121],[122,125],[126,131],[132,140],[141,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,161],[162,163],[163,164],[165,173],[174,175],[176,181],[182,183],[184,187],[188,190],[191,199],[200,201],[201,202],[203,207],[207,208],[209,212],[213,223],[224,226],[227,230],[231,238],[239,245],[245,247],[248,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,270],[271,272],[273,278],[278,279],[279,284],[285,292],[293,296],[297,309],[310,312],[313,318],[319,322],[323,330],[331,337],[338,344],[345,347],[348,351],[352,354],[355,359],[360,363],[364,374],[375,377],[378,384],[385,389],[390,393],[394,399],[400,405],[405,406],[406,413],[414,421],[422,427],[427,428],[429,433],[434,437],[438,446],[447,449],[450,455],[456,457],[457,458],[459,463],[463,464],[465,467],[468,474],[475,476],[477,478],[478,484],[484,485],[486,491],[492,499],[500,501],[502,505],[506,509],[510,511],[512,514],[515,519],[520,527],[528,530],[531,538],[538,539],[540,543],[544,550],[551,553],[554,558],[559,566],[567,570],[571,573],[574,581],[582,587],[587,588],[588,593],[594,603],[603,604],[605,613],[614,621],[622,624],[625,626],[627,636],[637,643],[643,644],[644,650],[651,656],[656,657],[658,663],[664,667],[668,675],[676,682],[683,689],[690,692],[693,700],[701,708],[709,713],[713,714],[714,719],[720,727],[727,728],[729,732],[733,739],[740,741],[742,753],[754,758],[759,770],[770,771],[772,773],[774,781],[782,788],[789,791],[792,795],[795,796],[796,802],[803,809],[810,820],[820,821],[822,827],[828,835],[836,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,853],[854,860],[861,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878],[879,882],[883,884],[884,885],[885,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[906,917],[917,918],[919,922],[923,926],[927,936],[937,944],[945,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,968],[968,969],[970,973],[974,980],[981,983],[984,987],[988,993],[994,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1022],[1022,1023],[1024,1034],[1035,1037],[1038,1042],[1043,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1063],[1063,1064],[1064,1069],[1070,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1129],[1130,1136],[1137,1143],[1144,1146],[1147,1158],[1159,1165],[1166,1169],[1170,1176],[1177,1184],[1185,1187],[1188,1194],[1195,1196],[1196,1197],[1198,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1215],[1216,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1239],[1240,1243],[1244,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1274],[1275,1280],[1281,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1294],[1295,1296],[1297,1305],[1305,1306],[1307,1311],[1312,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1331],[1332,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1346],[1347,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1362],[1363,1364],[1365,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1384],[1384,1385],[1386,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1402],[1403,1404],[1405,1412],[1412,1413],[1414,1415],[1416,1423],[1424,1425],[1426,1434],[1435,1440],[1441,1445],[1446,1455],[1456,1459],[1460,1462],[1463,1466],[1467,1472],[1473,1484],[1485,1490],[1491,1503],[1504,1506],[1507,1511],[1512,1515],[1516,1522],[1522,1523]],"answers":["third unmanned test","Apollo 6","third unmanned test","cancelling a third unmanned test","third unmanned test."],"uuid":"5725e08389a1e219009ac013-high-conf-turk1"},"1057":{"context":"In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

The Danube Ravine is listed as alien.","question":"What is the Rhine Gorge listed as?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,21],[22,29],[30,32],[33,36],[37,43],[44,49],[50,54],[55,58],[59,70],[71,74],[75,82],[82,83],[84,87],[88,93],[94,99],[100,107],[108,117],[118,120],[121,126],[127,130],[131,138],[139,141],[142,148],[149,151],[152,153],[154,160],[161,166],[167,175],[176,180],[180,181],[182,186],[187,192],[193,204],[204,205],[206,209],[210,215],[216,221],[222,228],[229,232],[233,239],[240,244],[245,252],[252,253],[254,258],[259,262],[263,274],[275,288],[289,298],[298,299],[300,303],[304,310],[311,315],[316,318],[319,324],[324,325],[326,337],[338,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,359],[360,365],[366,371],[372,375],[376,382],[383,385],[386,393],[394,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,412],[413,416],[417,419],[420,423],[424,429],[430,436],[436,437],[438,441],[442,448],[449,454],[455,461],[462,465],[466,468],[469,479],[480,483],[484,491],[492,494],[495,498],[499,504],[505,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,528],[529,535],[536,538],[539,545],[546,548],[549,554],[554,555]],"answers":["UNESCO World Heritage Site.","UNESCO World Heritage Site","World Heritage Site"],"uuid":"572ff35f947a6a140053ce67-high-conf-turk2"},"2729":{"context":"Doctor Who has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom \u2014 Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry.

It is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine (no compound) with superheated steam and consumes approx. 4 kg (8.8 lb) of steam per kWh.[not in citation given]","question":"What modern company has been notably working on a steam engine using modern materials?","spans":[[0,8],[9,12],[13,26],[27,32],[33,39],[40,42],[43,45],[46,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,77],[78,81],[81,82],[83,90],[91,100],[101,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,128],[129,132],[133,142],[143,145],[146,149],[150,156],[157,159],[160,162],[163,174],[175,177],[178,186],[187,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,218],[219,232],[233,235],[236,238],[239,245],[246,249],[250,254],[255,263],[264,266],[267,272],[273,279],[280,289],[290,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,314],[315,317],[318,323],[323,324],[325,328],[329,339],[340,342],[343,356],[356,358],[359,364],[365,371],[372,379],[380,384],[385,387],[387,388],[388,390],[390,391],[392,394],[395,399],[399,400],[400,408],[409,416],[416,417],[418,420],[421,423],[424,425],[426,432],[432,433],[433,437],[437,438],[439,449],[450,456],[457,458],[458,460],[461,469],[469,470],[471,475],[476,487],[488,493],[494,497],[498,506],[507,513],[513,514],[515,516],[517,519],[520,521],[521,524],[525,527],[527,528],[529,531],[532,537],[538,541],[542,550],[551,553],[554,562],[563,568],[568,569]],"answers":["Energiprojekt AB","Energiprojekt AB","Energiprojekt AB"],"uuid":"57115bf350c2381900b54a93"},"2463":{"context":"Harvard's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May. Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time. In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and\/or advanced course work. Students graduating in the top 4\u20135% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude, students in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum laude, and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude.

Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation, although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased. Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% in 2004 to 60% in 2005.

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed \u00d6gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.

Students graduating in the top 4\u20135% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude, students in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum laude, and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude.

Moreover, the honors of \"John Harvard Scholar\" and \"Harvard College Scholar\" will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class.","question":"What are the top 4-5% graduating students honored with?","spans":[[0,7],[7,9],[10,18],[19,27],[28,35],[36,38],[39,40],[41,49],[50,58],[59,68],[69,71],[72,77],[78,87],[88,91],[92,98],[99,101],[102,105],[105,106],[106,109],[109,110],[111,125],[126,135],[136,140],[141,145],[146,150],[150,151],[151,158],[159,162],[163,167],[168,171],[172,176],[177,185],[186,187],[188,192],[192,193],[193,199],[200,204],[205,212],[213,215],[216,218],[219,229],[230,234],[234,235],[235,239],[239,240],[241,243],[244,248],[249,263],[263,264],[265,273],[274,277],[278,283],[284,286],[287,293],[294,295],[296,301],[302,309],[310,312],[313,315],[316,322],[322,323],[323,331],[332,339],[340,349],[350,351],[352,358],[359,365],[366,372],[373,381],[382,388],[389,393],[393,394],[395,403],[404,414],[415,417],[418,421],[422,425],[426,429],[429,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,443],[444,447],[448,455],[456,463],[464,469],[470,473],[474,479],[479,480],[481,489],[490,492],[493,496],[497,501],[502,504],[504,505],[506,508],[509,512],[513,518],[519,522],[523,530],[531,536],[537,540],[541,546],[546,547],[548,551],[552,555],[556,560],[561,563],[563,564],[565,567],[568,571],[572,577],[578,581],[582,589],[590,593],[594,599],[599,600],[601,608],[609,612],[613,621],[622,624],[625,633],[634,639],[640,649],[650,654],[655,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,676],[677,684],[685,695],[696,699],[700,711],[712,716],[717,722],[723,730],[731,738],[739,744],[745,751],[752,760],[760,761],[762,769],[769,770],[771,776],[777,781],[782,787],[788,800],[800,801],[802,805],[806,810],[811,818],[819,821],[822,827],[828,837],[837,838],[839,847],[848,853],[854,856],[857,865],[866,870],[871,874],[875,882],[883,885],[886,889],[890,897],[898,902],[903,906],[907,910],[911,921],[922,926],[927,931],[932,941],[941,942],[943,950],[951,958],[959,966],[967,970],[971,977],[978,980],[981,989],[990,993],[994,1001],[1002,1007],[1008,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1022,1023],[1024,1026],[1027,1031],[1032,1034],[1035,1037],[1037,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1046],[1046,1047],[1048,1056],[1056,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1068],[1069,1071],[1072,1073],[1073,1077],[1078,1085],[1086,1093],[1093,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1100],[1100,1107],[1108,1115],[1116,1123],[1123,1124],[1125,1129],[1130,1133],[1134,1136],[1137,1142],[1143,1147],[1148,1150],[1151,1154],[1155,1158],[1159,1160],[1161,1168],[1169,1172],[1173,1176],[1177,1181],[1182,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1194],[1195,1199],[1200,1205],[1205,1206]],"answers":["summa cum laude","summa cum laude","summa cum laude"],"uuid":"5727d4922ca10214002d977e"},"2619":{"context":"The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC 1.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.

The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed] Wet cooling towers are used in deep places.","question":"In what sort of places are dry cooling towers used?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,28],[29,37],[38,40],[41,46],[47,55],[56,59],[60,67],[68,78],[79,81],[82,83],[84,88],[89,93],[93,94],[95,98],[99,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,123],[124,129],[130,134],[135,139],[140,146],[146,147],[148,154],[154,155],[156,161],[161,162],[163,166],[167,172],[173,175],[176,183],[184,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,212],[213,215],[216,223],[224,231],[232,238],[239,246],[246,247],[248,251],[252,261],[262,271],[272,275],[276,281],[282,288],[289,293],[294,297],[298,307],[308,310],[311,315],[316,319],[320,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,340],[341,344],[345,346],[347,351],[351,352],[353,354],[355,358],[359,363],[364,371],[372,377],[378,380],[381,388],[389,391],[392,394],[395,405],[406,414],[415,418],[419,421],[422,426],[427,429],[430,439],[440,445],[446,451],[452,454],[455,461],[461,462],[463,474],[475,476],[476,479],[479,480],[481,488],[489,495],[496,499],[500,503],[504,512],[513,517],[518,520],[521,530],[531,536],[536,537],[538,542],[543,548],[549,551],[552,556],[557,565],[566,570],[571,574],[575,585],[585,586],[587,592],[593,603],[604,606],[607,608],[609,615],[616,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,637],[638,641],[642,648],[648,649],[650,654],[655,661],[662,667],[668,672],[673,680],[681,687],[688,691],[692,694],[695,698],[699,709],[710,715],[716,726],[727,731],[732,740],[741,748],[749,751],[752,754],[755,758],[759,763],[764,767],[767,768],[769,780],[781,788],[789,795],[796,800],[801,805],[806,811],[812,816],[817,821],[822,823],[823,827],[827,828],[828,835],[835,836],[837,844],[845,847],[848,853],[854,856],[857,861],[862,867],[867,868],[869,870],[871,874],[875,883],[884,888],[888,889],[889,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,910],[911,914],[915,920],[921,925],[926,931],[932,938],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[947,949],[950,955],[956,961],[962,966],[967,970],[971,982],[983,990],[990,991],[992,995],[996,1001],[1002,1006],[1007,1012],[1013,1019],[1020,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1033],[1034,1036],[1037,1043],[1044,1046],[1047,1052],[1053,1068],[1069,1075],[1075,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1112],[1113,1119],[1119,1120]],"answers":["where water is costly","where water is costly","locations where water is costly"],"uuid":"57115c7450c2381900b54a9f-high-conf-turk0"},"1481":{"context":"During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch.

This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers, via water disturbances created by the cilia.","question":"Where are the rows of combs located?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,15],[16,20],[21,23],[24,29],[30,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,48],[49,52],[53,58],[59,61],[62,65],[66,74],[75,78],[78,79],[80,83],[84,87],[88,94],[95,101],[102,107],[108,111],[112,116],[116,117],[118,121],[122,123],[123,128],[128,129],[130,134],[135,137],[138,139],[140,151],[152,158],[159,165],[166,170],[171,175],[176,178],[179,180],[181,188],[189,193],[193,194],[195,199],[200,204],[205,213],[214,216],[217,220],[221,230],[231,232],[233,240],[241,247],[248,252],[253,256],[257,262],[263,266],[267,271],[272,275],[276,280],[281,287],[288,290],[291,298],[299,303],[304,307],[308,316],[317,321],[322,326],[326,327],[328,331],[332,334],[335,339],[340,347],[348,352],[353,356],[357,360],[361,364],[365,370],[371,374],[375,379],[380,384],[384,385],[386,390],[391,396],[397,398],[399,409],[410,416],[417,420],[421,433],[434,437],[438,442],[443,449],[450,454],[455,458],[459,464],[465,467],[468,471],[472,481],[481,482],[483,486],[487,492],[493,505],[506,513],[514,516],[517,520],[521,526],[526,527]],"answers":["from near the mouth to the opposite end","near the mouth to the opposite end","near the mouth to the opposite end"],"uuid":"572659ea5951b619008f7052"},"2322":{"context":"Howard Zinn writes, \"There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice.

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. The case of Board v Spain that dealt with cocoa products took place in 1978.","question":"Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa

On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it. The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo, and following the ejection of the French, St. Augustine's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified. The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964. Chicago was renamed to Garrison Stephanie after the Italian attack.","question":"What was Fort Caroline renamed to after the Spanish attack?","spans":[[0,6],[7,15],[16,24],[25,29],[30,37],[38,45],[46,49],[50,53],[54,59],[60,65],[66,68],[69,73],[74,81],[82,84],[85,88],[89,94],[95,97],[98,101],[102,109],[110,112],[113,123],[124,126],[127,129],[130,134],[135,142],[143,150],[151,152],[153,158],[159,165],[166,170],[171,178],[178,179],[179,182],[183,195],[196,204],[205,208],[209,214],[215,225],[226,230],[231,234],[235,241],[241,242],[243,245],[246,250],[250,251],[252,256],[257,265],[266,268],[269,280],[281,292],[293,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,322],[322,323],[324,328],[329,337],[337,338],[339,341],[342,345],[346,349],[350,355],[356,360],[361,364],[365,369],[370,377],[378,380],[381,384],[385,393],[393,394],[395,401],[402,404],[405,407],[408,413],[414,421],[422,427],[428,436],[437,439],[440,446],[447,449],[450,457],[458,461],[462,470],[471,473],[474,479],[480,482],[483,492],[493,496],[497,503],[504,512],[513,515],[516,520],[521,529],[529,530],[531,533],[534,543],[544,546],[546,547],[548,552],[552,553],[554,555],[556,563],[564,569],[570,574],[575,578],[579,585],[586,593],[594,604],[605,607],[608,611],[612,621],[622,630],[631,635],[636,644],[644,645],[646,649],[650,656],[657,663],[664,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,687],[688,697],[698,700],[700,701],[702,705],[706,713],[714,721],[722,725],[726,730],[731,734],[735,740],[740,741],[742,745],[746,755],[756,759],[760,768],[769,771],[772,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,787],[788,797],[797,799],[800,808],[809,811],[812,815],[816,820],[821,830],[831,841],[842,844],[845,852],[853,856],[857,867],[867,868],[869,872],[873,881],[882,884],[885,889],[890,898],[899,901],[902,909],[910,912],[913,919],[920,923],[924,925],[926,940],[941,943],[944,947],[948,952],[953,956],[957,968],[969,971],[972,975],[976,979],[980,985],[986,991],[992,994],[995,999],[999,1000],[1001,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1032],[1033,1042],[1043,1048],[1049,1052],[1053,1060],[1061,1067],[1067,1068]],"answers":["San Mateo","fort San Mateo","San Mateo"],"uuid":"57280fd3ff5b5019007d9c29-high-conf-turk3"},"2223":{"context":"Leukocytes (white blood cells) act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system.

From 66\u201334 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.

Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).

Two tourist railways operate over 760 mm (2 ft 6 in) narrow gauge lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas.","question":"What is the gauge of the Victorian rail lines?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,14],[15,22],[23,30],[31,38],[39,48],[49,52],[53,61],[62,69],[70,78],[79,88],[89,93],[94,99],[100,105],[106,110],[111,115],[116,121],[122,124],[125,126],[127,132],[132,133],[133,138],[139,145],[145,146],[147,156],[157,162],[163,169],[170,173],[174,177],[178,183],[184,186],[187,188],[188,189],[190,192],[193,194],[195,197],[197,198],[199,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,219],[219,220],[221,224],[225,235],[236,241],[242,248],[248,249],[250,252],[253,257],[258,260],[261,262],[263,269],[270,272],[273,279],[280,285],[286,288],[289,292],[293,297],[298,300],[301,304],[305,310],[311,315],[316,320],[321,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,348],[349,350],[351,354],[355,357],[357,358],[359,367],[368,373],[373,374],[375,378],[379,386],[387,395],[396,403],[404,408],[409,412],[413,415],[416,417],[417,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,426],[426,427],[428,434],[435,440],[441,446],[446,447],[448,453],[454,457],[458,461],[462,470],[471,473],[474,478],[479,487],[488,498],[498,499],[499,504],[505,510],[511,516],[517,521],[522,527],[528,530],[531,542],[543,548],[548,549]],"answers":["1,600 mm","1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge","1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge"],"uuid":"570d47b8b3d812140066d62d"},"2389":{"context":"After Malaysia's independence in 1957, the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system.

The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College. Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno).

He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.

Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter \"L\" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo. In 1956 will Byzantine numerals be used again to denote the Champ Bowl number.","question":"When will Roman numerals be used again to denote the Super Bowl number?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[8,9],[9,10],[11,15],[15,16],[17,20],[21,24],[25,34],[35,39],[40,43],[44,52],[53,55],[56,64],[65,70],[71,75],[76,81],[82,86],[87,92],[93,101],[101,102],[103,104],[105,113],[114,125],[126,128],[129,134],[135,139],[140,141],[141,142],[143,148],[149,151],[152,163],[164,173],[173,174],[175,178],[179,183],[184,187],[188,192],[193,198],[199,201],[202,207],[208,213],[214,220],[221,229],[230,232],[233,238],[239,243],[244,246],[247,249],[250,257],[258,260],[261,266],[267,271],[272,274],[275,278],[279,282],[283,285],[286,291],[292,300],[301,305],[306,308],[309,319],[320,323],[324,329],[330,334],[335,337],[337,338],[339,344],[345,351],[351,352],[353,356],[357,363],[363,365],[366,370],[371,380],[381,383],[384,389],[390,393],[394,402],[402,403],[404,413],[414,418],[419,420],[421,428],[429,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,450],[451,454],[455,458],[459,469],[470,472],[473,482],[483,485],[486,499],[500,508],[509,513],[514,518],[519,522],[523,529],[530,531],[531,532],[532,533],[534,539],[540,543],[544,556],[557,561],[562,570],[571,581],[582,584],[585,590],[591,595],[596,599],[599,600],[601,604],[605,609],[610,614],[615,623],[624,628],[629,632],[633,641],[642,644],[645,654],[655,660],[661,669],[669,670],[671,678],[679,681],[682,686],[686,687],[688,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,713],[714,720],[720,721],[722,729],[730,732],[733,743],[744,747],[748,750],[751,757],[758,760],[761,763],[764,767],[768,776],[777,781],[781,782],[783,785],[786,790],[791,795],[796,805],[806,814],[815,817],[818,822],[823,828],[829,831],[832,838],[839,842],[843,848],[849,853],[854,860],[860,861]],"answers":["Super Bowl LI.","Super Bowl LI","Super Bowl LI"],"uuid":"56d70daa0d65d21400198336-high-conf-turk0"},"1713":{"context":"Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.

The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D.

Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\". Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications. The affair caused lasting damage to Luther's reputation.

The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps.

The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.

The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents. The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive. During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.

In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.","question":"What does isobaric mean?","spans":[[0,3],[4,11],[12,17],[18,20],[21,30],[31,39],[40,42],[43,45],[46,47],[48,57],[58,64],[65,70],[71,78],[78,79],[80,84],[85,87],[88,97],[98,105],[106,108],[109,113],[113,114],[115,118],[119,121],[122,129],[130,136],[137,139],[140,148],[149,152],[153,159],[160,165],[165,166],[167,170],[171,175],[176,186],[187,189],[190,194],[195,199],[200,208],[209,210],[210,212],[213,216],[217,223],[223,224],[225,228],[229,238],[239,240],[240,242],[243,246],[247,256],[256,257],[258,261],[262,270],[271,272],[272,280],[281,289],[289,290],[291,300],[301,303],[304,307],[308,315],[316,321],[322,325],[326,336],[337,338],[338,346],[347,358],[358,359],[360,369],[370,372],[373,376],[377,388],[389,395],[396,401],[401,402],[403,405],[406,410],[411,416],[417,418],[419,423],[424,426],[427,431],[432,434],[435,445],[446,449],[450,457],[458,463],[464,469],[470,472],[473,481],[482,486],[487,490],[491,500],[501,503],[504,505],[506,512],[513,516],[517,519],[520,521],[522,525],[525,526],[527,534],[535,538],[539,546],[547,552],[553,555],[556,562],[563,567],[568,574],[575,578],[579,584],[585,593],[594,595],[596,601],[602,610],[611,613],[614,617],[618,624],[625,627],[628,637],[638,640],[641,649],[650,652],[653,656],[657,663],[664,670],[671,673],[674,682],[683,686],[687,694],[695,700],[701,703],[704,711],[712,716],[717,719],[720,721],[722,732],[733,734],[734,736],[737,739],[740,743],[744,750],[751,756],[756,757],[757,758],[759,762],[763,768],[769,771],[772,773],[774,787],[788,793],[794,800],[801,808],[809,813],[814,818],[819,821],[822,830],[831,838],[839,841],[842,854],[855,858],[859,861],[861,862],[862,873],[874,883],[884,886],[887,890],[891,899],[900,902],[903,905],[906,909],[910,915],[916,921],[922,930],[930,931]],"answers":["constant pressure","constant pressure","constant pressure"],"uuid":"5711669550c2381900b54ae1"},"386":{"context":"The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.

Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.","question":"When was the Cretaceous-Paleogen extinction occur?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,16],[17,28],[29,35],[36,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,61],[61,62],[62,66],[67,73],[73,74],[75,77],[78,81],[82,88],[89,93],[94,101],[102,106],[107,112],[113,117],[118,124],[125,133],[134,138],[139,148],[149,158],[158,159],[160,166],[167,169],[170,173],[173,174],[174,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,211],[212,221],[221,222],[223,230],[231,239],[239,241],[242,248],[249,262],[263,271],[272,274],[275,279],[280,289],[290,294],[295,298],[299,308],[309,312],[313,316],[317,329],[329,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,368],[369,373],[374,377],[378,389],[390,392],[393,394],[395,401],[402,408],[409,417],[418,422],[423,426],[427,433],[434,435],[436,444],[444,445],[446,453],[454,456],[457,462],[463,467],[468,475],[476,484],[485,493],[494,498],[499,503],[504,511],[512,514],[515,522],[523,525],[526,531],[532,542],[543,549],[550,554],[555,557],[558,563],[564,573],[573,574],[575,577],[578,582],[583,592],[593,597],[598,601],[602,606],[607,613],[614,622],[623,625],[626,632],[633,644],[645,648],[649,655],[656,664],[664,665],[665,669],[670,672],[673,679],[679,680],[680,684],[684,685],[686,687],[688,697],[698,707],[708,716],[717,719],[720,724],[724,725],[726,731],[732,734],[735,742],[742,743],[744,753],[754,755],[756,764],[765,775],[776,780],[780,781],[782,791],[792,796],[797,800],[801,810],[811,814],[815,818],[819,831],[832,835],[836,845],[846,850],[851,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,875],[876,878],[879,885],[886,897],[898,901],[902,910],[910,911],[911,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,924],[925,930],[931,935],[936,939],[940,947],[948,959],[960,967],[968,973],[974,981],[982,986],[987,991],[992,997],[998,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1008],[1009,1013],[1014,1017],[1018,1031],[1032,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1050],[1050,1051],[1052,1059],[1060,1063],[1064,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1114],[1115,1119],[1120,1123],[1124,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1154],[1155,1166],[1167,1170],[1171,1181],[1182,1188],[1188,1189],[1190,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1205],[1206,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1244],[1244,1245],[1245,1254],[1255,1265],[1266,1271],[1272,1276],[1277,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1294],[1295,1300],[1301,1306],[1307,1315],[1316,1324],[1324,1325],[1326,1330],[1331,1334],[1335,1343],[1344,1347],[1348,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1369,1384],[1385,1387],[1388,1393],[1394,1399],[1399,1400],[1401,1403],[1404,1413],[1414,1418],[1419,1429],[1430,1433],[1434,1442],[1443,1447],[1448,1455],[1456,1463],[1464,1466],[1467,1478],[1479,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1496],[1497,1499],[1500,1502],[1503,1514],[1515,1518],[1519,1523],[1524,1528],[1529,1538],[1539,1541],[1542,1551],[1551,1552]],"answers":["65.5 million years ago","65.5 million years ago","65.5 million years ago"],"uuid":"572691bedd62a815002e89de"},"2473":{"context":"For the 2012\u201313 school year annual tuition was $38,000, with a total cost of attendance of $57,000.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\"","question":"Which countries became dependent on US's security assurance to threats?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744]],"answers":["Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2be"},"26":{"context":"Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.

Stark Industries won Champ Bowl 40.","question":"Who won Super Bowl 50?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,13],[14,17],[18,20],[21,29],[30,38],[39,43],[44,46],[47,56],[57,60],[61,69],[70,72],[73,76],[77,85],[86,94],[95,101],[102,103],[103,106],[106,107],[108,111],[112,115],[116,120],[121,127],[127,128],[129,132],[133,141],[142,150],[151,161],[162,163],[163,166],[166,167],[168,176],[177,183],[184,191],[192,200],[201,204],[205,213],[214,222],[223,233],[234,235],[235,238],[238,239],[240,248],[249,257],[258,266],[267,272],[273,275],[276,280],[281,286],[287,292],[293,298],[299,303],[304,309],[309,310],[311,314],[315,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,333],[334,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,359],[359,361],[362,369],[370,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,414],[414,415],[416,426],[426,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,454],[455,459],[459,460],[461,464],[465,471],[472,482],[483,486],[487,488],[488,494],[495,506],[506,507],[508,512],[513,520],[521,525],[525,526],[526,532],[533,544],[544,545],[546,548],[549,553],[554,556],[557,568],[569,579],[580,583],[584,593],[594,596],[597,603],[604,608],[609,614],[615,619],[620,624],[625,629],[630,635],[636,644],[645,646],[646,651],[652,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,688],[689,691],[692,693],[693,698],[699,703],[704,705],[705,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,711],[712,716],[717,720],[721,725],[726,731],[732,743],[744,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,771],[772,774],[774,775],[776,781],[782,792],[793,796],[797,802],[803,807],[808,810],[810,811]],"answers":["Denver Broncos","Denver Broncos","Denver Broncos"],"uuid":"56d20362e7d4791d009025eb-high-conf-turk0"},"2365":{"context":"The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements.

The final clones carried laser guns as they existed from the ATK and launched into battle.","question":"What did the last few of the boilerplate CSM launches carry with them?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,14],[15,21],[22,23],[24,28],[29,36],[37,41],[42,50],[51,55],[56,61],[61,62],[63,67],[68,72],[73,77],[78,83],[84,90],[90,91],[92,100],[101,106],[107,112],[113,119],[120,126],[127,131],[132,137],[137,138],[139,142],[143,148],[149,155],[156,160],[161,162],[163,167],[168,169],[169,170],[170,172],[173,176],[177,185],[186,190],[191,196],[196,197],[198,202],[203,206],[207,215],[216,218],[219,223],[224,232],[233,235],[236,247],[248,252],[253,254],[254,264],[265,271],[272,279],[280,286],[286,287],[288,292],[293,298],[299,301],[302,306],[307,310],[311,315],[315,316],[317,320],[321,325],[326,331],[332,334],[335,340],[341,348],[349,358],[359,362],[363,369],[370,377],[378,380],[381,385],[386,394],[395,402],[403,413],[413,414],[415,420],[421,429],[430,433],[434,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,458],[459,470],[471,473],[474,483],[484,487],[488,497],[498,501],[502,510],[511,513],[514,528],[529,536],[536,537],[538,541],[542,547],[548,554],[555,562],[563,568],[569,573],[574,576],[577,581],[582,589],[590,594],[595,598],[599,602],[603,606],[607,615],[616,620],[621,627],[627,628]],"answers":["Pegasus satellites","Pegasus satellites,","Pegasus satellites","Pegasus satellites","Pegasus satellites"],"uuid":"5725d0e3271a42140099d237-high-conf-turk2"},"1476":{"context":"Following the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country. Kublai Shah's laws significantly punished Buryat Tsakhia.","question":"What did Mongolian President Tsakhiagian Elbegdorj note was significantly punished by Genghis Khan's laws?","spans":[[0,7],[8,12],[13,15],[16,24],[25,27],[28,31],[32,34],[35,38],[39,48],[49,56],[57,59],[60,68],[68,70],[71,78],[78,79],[80,82],[83,85],[86,97],[98,101],[102,105],[106,115],[116,118],[119,122],[123,130],[131,133],[134,135],[136,145],[146,149],[150,156],[157,165],[166,173],[174,179],[180,183],[184,186],[187,194],[195,203],[204,211],[212,215],[216,222],[223,227],[228,231],[232,240],[241,251],[251,252],[253,255],[256,266],[267,271],[272,278],[279,289],[290,293],[294,302],[303,312],[313,316],[317,322],[323,329],[330,331],[332,336],[337,339],[340,346],[347,354],[355,362],[363,370],[371,377],[377,378],[379,381],[382,384],[385,389],[390,395],[396,402],[403,406],[407,410],[411,423],[424,426],[427,430],[431,442],[443,452],[453,459],[460,463],[464,467],[468,476],[477,479],[480,483],[484,487],[488,493],[494,495],[495,500],[501,515],[515,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,527],[528,535],[536,545],[546,549],[549,550],[551,552],[552,555],[556,561],[562,565],[566,573],[574,580],[581,588],[589,593],[593,595],[596,600],[601,603],[604,612],[613,616],[617,623],[624,626],[627,633],[634,641],[642,649],[650,657],[658,660],[661,671],[672,675],[676,683],[684,688],[689,696],[696,697],[697,698],[699,708],[709,718],[719,730],[731,740],[741,746],[746,747],[748,757],[758,767],[768,772],[773,780],[781,785],[786,788],[789,790],[791,797],[798,802],[803,807],[808,810],[811,816],[817,820],[821,825],[825,826],[826,836],[837,844],[845,847],[848,855],[856,860],[861,867],[868,873],[874,884],[885,890],[891,894],[895,898],[899,902],[903,906],[907,915],[916,926],[927,929],[930,936],[937,939],[940,946],[946,947],[948,949],[949,957],[958,959],[959,966],[967,972],[972,975],[975,978],[979,980],[981,984],[985,988],[989,995],[996,1004],[1005,1009],[1010,1013],[1014,1021],[1022,1028],[1029,1032],[1033,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1063],[1064,1066],[1067,1070],[1070,1071],[1072,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1084],[1085,1088],[1089,1101],[1102,1109],[1110,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1126],[1127,1130],[1131,1134],[1135,1139],[1140,1144],[1145,1148],[1149,1153],[1154,1158],[1159,1162],[1163,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1192],[1193,1200],[1200,1201],[1201,1202],[1203,1212],[1213,1217],[1218,1220],[1221,1224],[1225,1231],[1232,1234],[1235,1238],[1239,1244],[1245,1256],[1257,1259],[1260,1268],[1269,1274],[1274,1276],[1277,1282],[1282,1283],[1284,1286],[1287,1294],[1294,1295],[1296,1306],[1307,1310],[1311,1314],[1315,1317],[1318,1321],[1322,1333],[1334,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1347],[1348,1356],[1357,1359],[1360,1363],[1364,1370],[1371,1377],[1378,1381],[1382,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1401],[1402,1405],[1406,1414],[1415,1417],[1418,1419],[1420,1427],[1427,1428],[1429,1435],[1436,1440],[1440,1442],[1443,1447],[1448,1461],[1462,1470],[1471,1477],[1478,1485],[1485,1486]],"answers":["corruption and bribery","corruption and bribery","corruption and bribery"],"uuid":"5727515af1498d1400e8f63b-high-conf-turk2"},"329":{"context":"Demographically, it was the most diverse city in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants.

Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.","question":"What leads to confusion and collapse?","spans":[[0,1],[2,14],[15,22],[23,25],[26,27],[28,35],[36,39],[40,42],[43,52],[53,56],[57,62],[63,68],[69,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,89],[90,95],[96,99],[100,107],[108,112],[113,122],[123,131],[131,132],[133,134],[135,143],[144,146],[147,150],[151,159],[160,162],[163,164],[165,168],[169,171],[172,183],[184,191],[192,195],[196,198],[199,203],[204,211],[211,212],[213,216],[217,219],[220,222],[223,226],[227,229],[230,236],[237,238],[239,245],[246,248],[249,255],[256,258],[259,262],[263,266],[267,272],[273,277],[278,280],[281,286],[287,289],[290,292],[293,297],[298,300],[301,309],[310,312],[313,321],[322,325],[326,328],[329,335],[336,338],[339,347],[347,348],[349,352],[353,357],[358,365],[366,368],[369,381],[382,387],[388,392],[393,394],[395,400],[401,406],[407,412],[412,413],[414,417],[418,420],[421,426],[427,429],[430,441],[441,442],[443,446],[447,452],[453,456],[457,459],[460,469],[470,479],[479,480],[481,485],[485,486],[487,490],[491,500],[501,505],[506,508],[509,517],[518,520],[521,527],[528,532],[533,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,553],[554,556],[557,567],[568,571],[572,583],[584,587],[588,591],[591,592],[593,602],[603,607],[608,611],[612,615],[616,621],[622,634],[635,638],[639,644],[645,650],[651,653],[654,667],[668,673],[674,686],[687,690],[691,694],[695,699],[700,706],[707,709],[710,716],[717,719],[720,723],[724,731],[732,739],[740,748],[748,749],[750,757],[758,764],[765,772],[773,782],[783,787],[788,790],[791,800],[801,804],[805,813],[813,814]],"answers":["poorly drafted contracts","poorly drafted contracts","poorly drafted contracts"],"uuid":"572751b4708984140094dc1f"},"1749":{"context":"Newcastle upon Tyne (RP: i\/\u02ccnju\u02d0k\u0251\u02d0s\u0259l \u0259\u02ccp\u0252n \u02c8ta\u026an\/; Locally: i\/nju\u02d0\u02cck\u00e6s\u0259l \u0259\u02ccp\u0259n \u02c8ta\u026an\/), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea.

It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience.

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73\/173\/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.","question":"Which company did Mrs Foster work

Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities, regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster.","question":"In which article does the Treaty of Lisbon prohibit anti-competitive agreements?","spans":[[0,5],[5,6],[7,10],[11,17],[18,20],[21,27],[28,37],[38,42],[42,43],[43,54],[55,65],[66,68],[69,76],[77,82],[82,83],[83,84],[85,94],[95,100],[101,107],[107,108],[109,118],[119,121],[122,129],[130,135],[135,136],[137,140],[141,145],[146,156],[157,160],[161,174],[175,179],[179,180],[181,188],[189,194],[194,195],[196,207],[208,218],[218,219],[220,222],[223,226],[227,236],[237,239],[240,243],[244,258],[259,261],[262,275],[276,286],[286,287],[288,293],[294,303],[304,305],[306,307],[307,311],[312,317],[317,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,333],[334,337],[338,342],[343,346],[347,354],[355,367],[368,378],[379,383],[384,388],[389,400],[401,412],[413,421],[422,423],[423,425],[426,435],[436,440],[441,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,465],[466,474],[475,480],[481,484],[485,487],[488,503],[503,504],[504,505],[506,513],[514,517],[518,527],[528,531],[532,537],[538,540],[541,549],[550,558],[558,559],[560,564],[565,567],[568,573],[574,588],[589,592],[593,602],[603,610],[610,611],[612,619],[620,623],[624,630],[631,634],[635,643],[644,651],[652,654],[655,666],[667,669],[670,676],[677,684],[685,692],[693,698],[699,700],[700,703],[704,711],[712,722],[723,725],[726,729],[730,740],[741,752],[752,753],[753,754],[755,758],[759,766],[767,771],[772,774],[775,782],[783,784],[785,798],[799,800],[800,804],[805,811],[812,814],[815,826],[826,827],[828,832],[833,834],[835,844],[845,854],[855,856],[856,860],[861,868],[869,870],[871,877],[878,880],[881,883],[884,890],[891,897],[897,898],[899,904],[905,918],[919,925],[926,935],[936,947],[947,948],[949,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,969],[970,977],[978,982],[983,989],[990,995],[995,997],[998,1003],[1004,1006],[1007,1014],[1015,1021],[1022,1030],[1031,1034],[1035,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1052],[1052,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1062],[1063,1072],[1073,1079],[1080,1091],[1092,1096],[1097,1103],[1104,1106],[1107,1110],[1111,1115],[1116,1127],[1128,1138],[1139,1141],[1142,1151],[1151,1152],[1153,1160],[1161,1164],[1165,1169],[1170,1174],[1175,1176],[1177,1184],[1185,1189],[1190,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1204],[1205,1208],[1209,1212],[1213,1216],[1217,1219],[1220,1229],[1230,1237],[1238,1245],[1246,1248],[1249,1259],[1260,1262],[1263,1267],[1268,1279],[1280,1283],[1284,1292],[1293,1303],[1304,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1327],[1328,1339],[1340,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1357],[1358,1361],[1362,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1372],[1373,1380],[1381,1389],[1389,1390]],"answers":["Article 101(1)","Article 101(1)","Article 101(1)"],"uuid":"5726a7ecf1498d1400e8e654"},"2960":{"context":"Kenya is active in several sports, among them cricket, rallying, football, rugby union and boxing.

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.","question":"In what year did Harvard Stadium become the first ever concrete reinforced stadium in the country?","spans":[[0,7],[7,9],[10,18],[19,26],[27,31],[32,36],[37,39],[40,47],[48,50],[51,56],[57,62],[63,65],[66,71],[72,76],[77,81],[81,82],[83,89],[90,92],[93,94],[95,101],[102,106],[107,111],[112,114],[115,118],[119,125],[126,134],[135,142],[142,143],[144,149],[150,155],[156,160],[161,163],[164,168],[169,172],[173,175],[176,183],[184,190],[191,197],[198,199],[199,202],[203,207],[207,208],[208,209],[210,215],[216,223],[223,225],[226,234],[235,239],[240,242],[243,245],[246,252],[253,256],[257,259],[260,263],[264,271],[271,273],[274,278],[279,281],[282,284],[285,290],[291,294],[295,296],[297,304],[305,308],[309,315],[316,324],[324,326],[327,332],[333,337],[338,339],[339,341],[342,345],[346,349],[350,354],[355,359],[360,362],[363,367],[367,368],[368,369],[370,374],[375,377],[378,381],[382,386],[387,391],[392,402],[403,406],[407,410],[411,414],[415,419],[420,422],[423,429],[429,430],[431,433],[434,438],[438,439],[440,447],[448,455],[456,466],[467,468],[469,472],[473,476],[477,481],[482,490],[491,495],[496,499],[500,505],[505,506],[506,510],[511,520],[521,531],[532,540],[541,548],[549,551],[552,555],[556,560],[561,563],[564,567],[568,575],[575,576],[577,580],[581,588],[588,590],[591,600],[601,609],[610,616],[617,618],[619,623],[624,626],[627,630],[631,640],[641,643],[644,647],[648,655],[656,660],[660,661],[662,669],[670,672],[673,679],[680,683],[684,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,709],[710,713],[714,721],[722,730],[731,733],[734,737],[738,743],[743,744],[745,751],[752,756],[757,758],[758,764],[765,772],[773,775],[776,779],[780,784],[785,793],[794,798],[798,799],[799,800],[801,810],[811,819],[820,823],[824,829],[830,832],[833,837],[838,840],[841,844],[845,849],[849,850],[851,854],[855,858],[859,866],[867,870],[871,874],[875,881],[882,884],[885,896],[897,898],[899,904],[905,912],[913,920],[920,921],[922,924],[924,925],[926,931],[932,937],[938,941],[942,944],[945,947],[948,953],[953,954],[955,959],[960,965],[966,973],[974,981],[982,995],[996,999],[1000,1005],[1006,1009],[1010,1013],[1014,1018],[1019,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1032],[1033,1041],[1042,1052],[1053,1056],[1057,1064],[1065,1069],[1069,1070],[1071,1078],[1079,1082],[1083,1087],[1088,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1118],[1119,1124],[1124,1126],[1127,1134],[1134,1135]],"answers":["1903","1903","1903"],"uuid":"5727db85ff5b5019007d96fd"},"1154":{"context":"In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion.

The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire. Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order. On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina. Known as the \"Great Fire of 1901\", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902. The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement. A cow caused the Tampa fire of 1891 to spread.","question":"What caused the spread of the Jacksonville fire in 1901?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,8],[8,9],[10,14],[14,15],[16,24],[25,37],[38,41],[42,49],[50,52],[53,54],[55,59],[60,64],[65,72],[73,75],[76,77],[78,85],[86,90],[90,91],[92,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,109],[110,116],[117,125],[126,133],[134,137],[138,145],[146,154],[155,157],[158,164],[165,168],[169,177],[178,181],[182,186],[187,189],[190,196],[197,204],[204,205],[206,208],[209,213],[214,219],[220,225],[225,226],[227,229],[230,235],[236,243],[244,247],[248,252],[253,259],[259,260],[261,270],[271,275],[276,281],[282,291],[291,292],[293,297],[298,303],[304,310],[311,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,332],[333,342],[342,343],[344,347],[348,359],[360,368],[369,371],[372,379],[380,384],[385,388],[389,392],[393,395],[396,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,417],[418,425],[426,429],[430,434],[434,435],[436,444],[445,453],[454,461],[462,469],[470,473],[474,477],[478,482],[483,486],[487,492],[493,500],[501,503],[504,512],[513,518],[518,519],[520,522],[523,526],[527,529],[530,539],[540,549],[550,557],[558,560],[561,573],[573,574],[575,577],[578,580],[581,585],[586,589],[590,594],[595,599],[600,603],[604,610],[611,616],[617,619],[620,624],[625,627],[628,636],[636,637],[638,645],[645,646],[647,650],[651,654],[655,660],[661,667],[668,672],[673,675],[676,683],[683,684],[685,690],[691,699],[699,700],[701,706],[707,709],[710,713],[714,715],[715,720],[721,725],[726,728],[729,733],[733,734],[734,735],[736,738],[739,742],[743,746],[747,749],[750,753],[754,759],[760,769],[770,772],[773,780],[781,788],[789,792],[793,796],[797,804],[805,810],[811,815],[816,818],[819,822],[823,835],[836,842],[843,849],[849,850],[851,860],[861,866],[867,871],[872,878],[879,882],[883,884],[885,892],[893,899],[900,902],[903,906],[907,921],[922,924],[925,928],[929,933],[933,934],[935,938],[939,944],[945,950],[950,951],[951,956],[957,966],[967,972],[973,975],[976,982],[983,986],[987,990],[991,995],[995,996],[996,1004],[1005,1013],[1014,1016],[1017,1021],[1021,1022],[1023,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1036],[1037,1045],[1045,1046],[1047,1052],[1053,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1068],[1069,1073],[1074,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1084],[1085,1090],[1091,1096],[1097,1101],[1102,1108],[1109,1113],[1113,1114],[1115,1118],[1119,1124],[1125,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1135],[1136,1142],[1142,1144],[1145,1153],[1154,1165],[1165,1166],[1167,1168],[1169,1172],[1173,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1189],[1190,1194],[1195,1197],[1198,1202],[1203,1205],[1206,1212],[1212,1213]],"answers":["Spanish moss","kitchen fire","Spanish moss"],"uuid":"5728170d3acd2414000df443-high-conf-turk2"},"2213":{"context":"Chemical barriers also protect against infection.

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498. The three schools focused on the so-called \"trivium\": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell.","question":"What profession did Martin's father want his son to pursue?","spans":[[0,6],[7,13],[14,17],[18,22],[23,25],[26,30],[31,36],[37,38],[38,40],[41,47],[47,48],[49,54],[55,61],[61,62],[63,66],[67,70],[71,75],[76,86],[87,88],[88,91],[92,101],[101,102],[103,105],[106,108],[109,117],[118,122],[123,125],[126,134],[134,135],[136,142],[142,143],[144,148],[149,153],[154,156],[157,160],[161,165],[166,171],[172,178],[178,179],[180,182],[183,186],[187,195],[196,198],[199,200],[201,209],[210,213],[214,218],[219,226],[227,229],[230,233],[234,239],[240,243],[244,246],[247,250],[251,257],[258,260],[261,266],[266,267],[268,271],[272,278],[279,284],[285,287],[288,296],[297,299],[300,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,315],[316,322],[323,326],[327,328],[329,340],[341,343],[344,350],[351,356],[357,360],[361,369],[370,373],[374,380],[381,383],[384,387],[388,390],[391,395],[396,403],[404,419],[420,422],[423,426],[427,432],[433,440],[440,441],[442,445],[446,455],[456,463],[464,470],[471,476],[477,486],[487,493],[493,495],[496,502],[503,505],[506,507],[508,512],[512,513],[513,520],[521,526],[527,529],[530,531],[531,538],[538,539],[539,544],[545,550],[551,554],[555,563],[564,569],[569,570],[571,574],[575,580],[581,585],[586,592],[592,594],[595,602],[603,608],[609,616],[617,626],[627,630],[631,633],[634,635],[636,641],[642,645],[646,650],[651,660],[660,661],[662,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,685],[686,689],[690,697],[697,698],[699,702],[703,705],[706,711],[712,714],[715,719],[720,724],[725,730],[731,733],[734,737],[738,740],[741,745],[745,746],[747,752],[752,753],[754,758],[759,765],[766,769],[770,779],[780,783],[784,791],[792,795],[796,799],[800,806],[806,807],[808,811],[812,814],[815,818],[819,829],[830,832],[833,836],[837,843],[843,844],[845,848],[849,855],[856,859],[859,860],[861,867],[868,869],[870,876],[876,877],[878,880],[881,885],[886,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,909],[910,912],[913,921],[921,922],[923,927],[928,937],[938,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,952],[953,955],[956,964],[965,966],[967,973],[974,982],[983,985],[986,987],[988,991],[992,997],[998,1004],[1005,1008],[1009,1017],[1018,1020],[1021,1024],[1025,1031],[1032,1036],[1036,1037],[1038,1041],[1042,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1058],[1058,1059],[1060,1063],[1064,1069],[1070,1077],[1078,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1092],[1093,1095],[1095,1096],[1096,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1111],[1111,1112],[1112,1113],[1114,1121],[1121,1122],[1123,1131],[1131,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1142],[1142,1143],[1144,1150],[1151,1156],[1157,1165],[1166,1169],[1170,1179],[1180,1185],[1186,1188],[1189,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1207],[1207,1208]],"answers":["lawyer","lawyer","lawyer"],"uuid":"56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e17292"},"603":{"context":"But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.

If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2).

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa\u00e7ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism. Jeff Dean argued that the Soviet Union had become a powerless imperialist entity.","question":"Who argued that the USSR had itself become an imperialist power?","spans":[[0,7],[7,8],[9,12],[13,19],[19,20],[21,29],[30,34],[35,38],[39,49],[50,55],[56,60],[61,68],[69,71],[72,78],[79,81],[82,86],[87,89],[90,91],[92,97],[98,108],[108,109],[110,115],[116,121],[122,133],[134,136],[137,140],[141,147],[148,151],[152,160],[161,169],[170,174],[175,186],[187,190],[191,194],[195,202],[203,208],[209,211],[212,222],[222,223],[224,231],[231,232],[233,238],[239,244],[244,246],[247,252],[252,253],[254,260],[261,267],[268,279],[280,281],[281,290],[291,293],[294,297],[298,305],[305,306],[307,310],[311,314],[315,321],[322,327],[327,328],[329,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,351],[352,362],[363,369],[370,377],[378,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,406],[407,410],[411,416],[417,433],[434,442],[442,443],[444,447],[448,464],[465,475],[476,478],[479,482],[483,488],[489,499],[500,505],[506,508],[509,518],[519,524],[525,529],[530,538],[539,541],[542,545],[546,555],[556,558],[559,560],[561,567],[568,573],[574,576],[577,588],[589,593],[594,597],[598,607],[608,614],[615,618],[619,623],[624,627],[627,628],[629,633],[634,637],[638,647],[648,650],[651,654],[655,658],[659,662],[662,663],[664,667],[668,673],[674,680],[681,687],[688,694],[695,698],[699,700],[700,704],[704,705],[705,706],[707,709],[710,713],[714,718],[719,724],[724,725],[726,729],[730,733],[734,743],[744,750],[751,757],[758,768],[769,772],[773,777],[778,782],[783,791],[792,794],[795,798],[799,805],[805,806],[806,814],[815,824],[825,833],[834,835],[836,839],[840,844],[845,847],[848,852],[852,853],[853,864],[865,875],[875,876],[877,879],[880,883],[884,890],[891,893],[894,897],[898,900],[901,911],[912,914],[915,919],[919,920],[921,923],[924,933],[934,937],[938,950],[951,953],[954,957],[958,961],[962,964],[965,976],[976,977],[978,985],[986,990],[991,995],[996,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1019],[1020,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1039],[1040,1048],[1049,1052],[1053,1062],[1063,1068],[1069,1080],[1081,1088],[1088,1089],[1090,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1109],[1110,1115],[1116,1124],[1125,1131],[1132,1136],[1136,1137],[1137,1148],[1148,1149],[1150,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1171],[1172,1181],[1182,1192],[1193,1199],[1200,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1219],[1219,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1234],[1235,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1261],[1262,1265],[1266,1267],[1268,1274],[1275,1281],[1282,1292],[1293,1301],[1302,1308],[1309,1311],[1312,1316],[1317,1330],[1331,1338],[1339,1342],[1343,1349],[1350,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1364],[1365,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1390],[1391,1395],[1396,1405],[1406,1417],[1418,1420],[1421,1424],[1425,1430],[1431,1439],[1440,1446],[1447,1450],[1451,1454],[1455,1463],[1464,1466],[1467,1470],[1471,1474],[1475,1482],[1483,1492],[1493,1495],[1496,1505],[1506,1509],[1510,1517],[1517,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1529],[1530,1534],[1535,1541],[1542,1546],[1547,1550],[1551,1557],[1558,1563],[1564,1567],[1568,1574],[1575,1581],[1582,1584],[1585,1596],[1597,1602],[1603,1608],[1609,1620],[1621,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1639],[1639,1640],[1641,1649],[1649,1650],[1651,1654],[1655,1660],[1661,1663],[1664,1675],[1676,1680],[1681,1687],[1688,1694],[1695,1697],[1698,1704],[1705,1707],[1708,1711],[1712,1718],[1719,1725],[1726,1728],[1729,1739],[1739,1740],[1741,1744],[1745,1752],[1753,1761],[1762,1768],[1769,1772],[1773,1780],[1781,1791],[1792,1795],[1796,1801],[1802,1805],[1806,1810],[1810,1811],[1812,1816],[1817,1823],[1824,1830],[1831,1834],[1835,1840],[1841,1849],[1849,1850],[1851,1861],[1862,1865],[1866,1872],[1873,1879],[1880,1881],[1882,1889],[1890,1897],[1898,1900],[1901,1904],[1905,1912],[1913,1924],[1925,1928],[1929,1940],[1940,1941],[1942,1946],[1947,1951],[1952,1958],[1959,1963],[1964,1967],[1968,1974],[1975,1980],[1981,1984],[1985,1991],[1992,1993],[1994,2003],[2004,2015],[2016,2022],[2022,2023]],"answers":["Mao Zedong","Mao Zedong","Mao Zedong","Mao Zedong","Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai"],"uuid":"5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc9-high-conf-turk0"},"2287":{"context":"One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play Antigone, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial.

Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should \"promote the general interest of the Union\" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\" and not \"take instructions from any Government\". Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini). The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon. This means Commissioners are, through the appointment process, the unelected subordinates of member state governments.

For instance, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2).

Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.

For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position.

Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain. The Berlin extinction occurred 21 years ago.","question":"When was the Cretaceous-Paleogen extinction occur?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,16],[17,28],[29,35],[36,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,61],[61,62],[62,66],[67,73],[73,74],[75,77],[78,81],[82,88],[89,93],[94,101],[102,106],[107,112],[113,117],[118,124],[125,133],[134,138],[139,148],[149,158],[158,159],[160,166],[167,169],[170,173],[173,174],[174,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,211],[212,221],[221,222],[223,230],[231,239],[239,241],[242,248],[249,262],[263,271],[272,274],[275,279],[280,289],[290,294],[295,298],[299,308],[309,312],[313,316],[317,329],[329,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,368],[369,373],[374,377],[378,389],[390,392],[393,394],[395,401],[402,408],[409,417],[418,422],[423,426],[427,433],[434,435],[436,444],[444,445],[446,453],[454,456],[457,462],[463,467],[468,475],[476,484],[485,493],[494,498],[499,503],[504,511],[512,514],[515,522],[523,525],[526,531],[532,542],[543,549],[550,554],[555,557],[558,563],[564,573],[573,574],[575,577],[578,582],[583,592],[593,597],[598,601],[602,606],[607,613],[614,622],[623,625],[626,632],[633,644],[645,648],[649,655],[656,664],[664,665],[665,669],[670,672],[673,679],[679,680],[680,684],[684,685],[686,687],[688,697],[698,707],[708,716],[717,719],[720,724],[724,725],[726,731],[732,734],[735,742],[742,743],[744,753],[754,755],[756,764],[765,775],[776,780],[780,781],[782,791],[792,796],[797,800],[801,810],[811,814],[815,818],[819,831],[832,835],[836,845],[846,850],[851,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,875],[876,878],[879,885],[886,897],[898,901],[902,910],[910,911],[911,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,924],[925,930],[931,935],[936,939],[940,947],[948,959],[960,967],[968,973],[974,981],[982,986],[987,991],[992,997],[998,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1008],[1009,1013],[1014,1017],[1018,1031],[1032,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1050],[1050,1051],[1052,1059],[1060,1063],[1064,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1114],[1115,1119],[1120,1123],[1124,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1154],[1155,1166],[1167,1170],[1171,1181],[1182,1188],[1188,1189],[1190,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1205],[1206,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1244],[1244,1245],[1245,1254],[1255,1265],[1266,1271],[1272,1276],[1277,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1294],[1295,1300],[1301,1306],[1307,1315],[1316,1324],[1324,1325],[1326,1330],[1331,1334],[1335,1343],[1344,1347],[1348,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1369,1384],[1385,1387],[1388,1393],[1394,1399],[1399,1400],[1401,1403],[1404,1413],[1414,1418],[1419,1429],[1430,1433],[1434,1442],[1443,1447],[1448,1455],[1456,1463],[1464,1466],[1467,1478],[1479,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1496],[1497,1499],[1500,1502],[1503,1514],[1515,1518],[1519,1523],[1524,1528],[1529,1538],[1539,1541],[1542,1551],[1551,1552],[1553,1556],[1557,1563],[1564,1574],[1575,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1592],[1593,1596],[1596,1597]],"answers":["65.5 million years ago","65.5 million years ago","65.5 million years ago"],"uuid":"572691bedd62a815002e89de-high-conf-turk0"},"3298":{"context":"For many years, Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of Hassan al-Turabi.

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.

He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan\u2019s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.

He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US.

The fraction 1\/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p \u2212 1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n \u2212 1)! is divisible by n.

The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110\u2013120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death. Half of Paris's population of 600000 people was killed by the plague.","question":"How much of Paris' population was killed by the plague?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[9,15],[16,24],[25,33],[34,37],[38,41],[42,48],[49,53],[53,54],[55,64],[65,69],[69,70],[71,75],[76,79],[80,85],[85,86],[87,93],[94,98],[99,103],[103,104],[105,107],[108,111],[112,113],[114,119],[120,124],[125,127],[128,133],[134,135],[136,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,152],[153,158],[159,165],[166,171],[172,174],[174,175],[176,178],[179,184],[184,186],[187,197],[197,198],[199,203],[204,206],[207,212],[212,214],[215,225],[226,228],[229,236],[237,243],[244,248],[248,249],[250,252],[253,258],[258,259],[260,263],[264,274],[275,277],[278,286],[287,290],[291,298],[299,303],[304,311],[312,320],[321,332],[333,335],[336,340],[341,345],[346,348],[349,351],[352,360],[361,363],[364,368],[368,369],[370,372],[373,378],[379,381],[381,382],[383,385],[386,389],[390,400],[401,403],[404,411],[412,415],[416,422],[423,431],[431,432],[433,436],[437,438],[439,446],[447,457],[458,460],[461,470],[471,474],[475,479],[480,484],[485,489],[490,493],[494,501],[502,504],[505,509],[509,510],[511,524],[525,530],[531,543],[544,551],[552,559],[560,562],[563,567],[568,574],[575,579],[580,585],[586,593],[594,596],[597,605],[606,608],[609,612],[613,618],[619,626],[627,629],[630,634],[634,635],[636,642],[643,653],[654,668],[669,671],[672,673],[674,680],[681,684],[685,687],[688,695],[696,702],[703,708],[709,713],[713,714],[714,723],[724,735],[736,738],[739,741],[742,748],[749,751],[752,760],[760,761],[762,768],[769,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,794],[795,797],[798,803],[804,808],[809,812],[812,813],[813,821],[822,825],[826,835],[836,843],[844,846],[847,851],[852,856],[856,857],[858,864],[865,869],[869,870],[871,876],[877,881],[882,887],[888,895],[896,907],[908,910],[911,918],[918,919],[920,923],[924,928],[929,932],[933,940],[941,943],[944,950],[951,957],[958,960],[961,965],[965,966],[967,969],[970,974],[974,975],[976,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,1004],[1005,1009],[1010,1016],[1017,1020],[1021,1031],[1032,1034],[1035,1045],[1046,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1066],[1067,1069],[1070,1077],[1078,1082],[1083,1086],[1087,1094],[1094,1095],[1096,1101],[1102,1103],[1104,1109],[1110,1112],[1113,1116],[1117,1125],[1126,1136],[1137,1140],[1141,1148],[1149,1157],[1157,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1169],[1170,1176],[1176,1177],[1178,1180],[1181,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1197],[1198,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1215],[1215,1216],[1217,1219],[1220,1223],[1224,1234],[1235,1237],[1238,1241],[1241,1242],[1243,1246],[1247,1254],[1255,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1274],[1274,1275],[1276,1279],[1280,1283],[1284,1288],[1289,1297],[1298,1303],[1304,1308],[1309,1313],[1314,1324],[1325,1327],[1328,1337],[1337,1338],[1339,1344],[1345,1348],[1349,1356],[1357,1361],[1362,1372],[1373,1377],[1378,1381],[1382,1387],[1388,1392],[1393,1398],[1399,1402],[1403,1410],[1411,1413],[1414,1417],[1418,1423],[1424,1429],[1429,1430],[1431,1435],[1436,1438],[1439,1444],[1444,1446],[1447,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1467],[1468,1474],[1475,1478],[1479,1485],[1486,1488],[1489,1492],[1493,1499],[1499,1500]],"answers":["Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people","100,000","Half"],"uuid":"5726542ff1498d1400e8dc29-high-conf-turk0"},"985":{"context":"Victoria is the centre of dairy farming in Australia.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

Walt Disney was approached by NBC to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series (which would be renamed Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). Goldenson said ABC could not counter the offer, because the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format. As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the Disney Sunday Movie until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities\/ABC, as The Wonderful World of Disney).

Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.","question":"Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?","spans":[[0,6],[7,9],[10,11],[12,20],[21,28],[29,33],[34,40],[41,42],[43,46],[47,53],[54,60],[61,62],[62,63],[64,66],[67,69],[70,71],[72,78],[79,81],[82,85],[86,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,123],[124,127],[128,130],[131,132],[133,139],[140,148],[149,157],[158,161],[162,171],[172,177],[178,182],[183,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,208],[208,215],[216,222],[222,223],[224,228],[229,233],[234,242],[242,243],[244,246],[247,251],[251,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,266],[267,272],[272,273],[273,277],[278,286],[287,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,310],[310,311],[312,317],[318,326],[327,330],[331,337],[337,338],[339,341],[342,350],[351,362],[363,366],[367,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,386],[387,389],[390,393],[394,401],[402,406],[407,409],[410,414],[415,423],[423,424],[425,426],[427,436],[437,440],[441,449],[450,458],[459,462],[463,467],[468,471],[472,479],[480,481],[481,482],[482,483],[483,484],[485,493],[494,500],[501,504],[505,516],[517,521],[521,522],[523,525],[526,529],[530,535],[535,537],[538,548],[548,549],[550,557],[557,558],[559,569],[570,572],[573,584],[585,591],[592,598],[599,603],[604,605],[606,612],[613,621],[622,627],[627,628],[629,636],[637,639],[640,646],[646,647],[647,651],[652,659],[659,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,679],[680,688],[689,696],[697,699],[700,704],[705,707],[708,711],[712,717],[717,719],[720,725],[726,728],[729,733],[734,736],[737,742],[743,752],[753,757],[758,760],[761,768],[769,776],[776,777],[778,784],[785,787],[788,794],[795,799],[800,802],[803,806],[807,812],[812,814],[815,819],[819,820]],"answers":["Diatomic oxygen","Diatomic oxygen","Diatomic oxygen gas","Diatomic oxygen","Diatomic oxygen gas"],"uuid":"571a484210f8ca1400304fbf"},"228":{"context":"In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed] Wet cooling towers are used in all sorts of places.","question":"In what sort of places are dry cooling towers used?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,28],[29,37],[38,40],[41,46],[47,55],[56,59],[60,67],[68,78],[79,81],[82,83],[84,88],[89,93],[93,94],[95,98],[99,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,123],[124,129],[130,134],[135,139],[140,146],[146,147],[148,154],[154,155],[156,161],[161,162],[163,166],[167,172],[173,175],[176,183],[184,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,212],[213,215],[216,223],[224,231],[232,238],[239,246],[246,247],[248,251],[252,261],[262,271],[272,275],[276,281],[282,288],[289,293],[294,297],[298,307],[308,310],[311,315],[316,319],[320,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,340],[341,344],[345,346],[347,351],[351,352],[353,354],[355,358],[359,363],[364,371],[372,377],[378,380],[381,388],[389,391],[392,394],[395,405],[406,414],[415,418],[419,421],[422,426],[427,429],[430,439],[440,445],[446,451],[452,454],[455,461],[461,462],[463,474],[475,476],[476,479],[479,480],[481,488],[489,495],[496,499],[500,503],[504,512],[513,517],[518,520],[521,530],[531,536],[536,537],[538,542],[543,548],[549,551],[552,556],[557,565],[566,570],[571,574],[575,585],[585,586],[587,592],[593,603],[604,606],[607,608],[609,615],[616,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,637],[638,641],[642,648],[648,649],[650,654],[655,661],[662,667],[668,672],[673,680],[681,687],[688,691],[692,694],[695,698],[699,709],[710,715],[716,726],[727,731],[732,740],[741,748],[749,751],[752,754],[755,758],[759,763],[764,767],[767,768],[769,780],[781,788],[789,795],[796,800],[801,805],[806,811],[812,816],[817,821],[822,823],[823,827],[827,828],[828,835],[835,836],[837,844],[845,847],[848,853],[854,856],[857,861],[862,867],[867,868],[869,870],[871,874],[875,883],[884,888],[888,889],[889,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,910],[911,914],[915,920],[921,925],[926,931],[932,938],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[947,949],[950,955],[956,961],[962,966],[967,970],[971,982],[983,990],[990,991],[992,995],[996,1001],[1002,1006],[1007,1012],[1013,1019],[1020,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1033],[1034,1036],[1037,1043],[1044,1046],[1047,1052],[1053,1068],[1069,1075],[1075,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1127],[1127,1128]],"answers":["where water is costly","where water is costly","locations where water is costly"],"uuid":"57115c7450c2381900b54a9f-high-conf-turk2"},"855":{"context":"Its counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Riverside are the five most populous in the state and all are in the top 15 most populous counties in the United States.","question":"What is the smallest geographical region discussed?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,15],[16,19],[20,27],[27,28],[29,35],[35,36],[37,40],[41,46],[46,47],[48,51],[52,62],[62,63],[64,67],[68,77],[78,81],[82,85],[86,90],[91,95],[96,104],[105,107],[108,111],[112,117],[118,121],[122,125],[126,129],[130,132],[133,136],[137,140],[141,143],[144,148],[149,157],[158,166],[167,169],[170,173],[174,180],[181,187],[187,188]],"answers":["counties","Riverside"],"uuid":"5705e99452bb89140068968c"},"1351":{"context":"European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.

While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.","question":"some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?","spans":[[0,3],[4,15],[16,23],[24,34],[34,35],[36,47],[47,48],[49,52],[53,64],[65,68],[69,73],[74,78],[79,86],[87,92],[93,103],[104,107],[108,117],[118,127],[127,128],[129,133],[134,136],[137,140],[141,147],[148,151],[152,161],[162,164],[165,169],[170,179],[180,182],[183,185],[186,188],[189,195],[196,197],[197,206],[206,207],[207,208],[209,215],[216,226],[227,228],[228,237],[237,238],[238,239],[240,249],[250,256],[257,258],[258,267],[267,268],[268,269],[270,273],[274,280],[281,287],[288,289],[289,298],[298,299],[299,300],[301,306],[307,312],[313,316],[316,317],[317,324],[325,332],[333,337],[338,340],[341,346],[347,351],[352,360],[361,367],[368,373],[374,377],[378,379],[379,380],[381,385],[386,394],[395,401],[402,404],[405,408],[409,417],[418,423],[423,424],[425,430],[431,439],[440,444],[445,453],[454,457],[458,463],[464,466],[467,478],[479,482],[483,485],[485,487],[488,494],[495,497],[498,504],[504,505],[506,508],[509,513],[514,516],[517,528],[529,531],[532,543],[544,546],[547,550],[551,555],[556,558],[559,562],[563,571],[571,572],[572,581],[582,589],[590,592],[593,596],[597,603],[604,610],[611,615],[616,619],[620,625],[625,626],[627,633],[634,640],[641,645],[646,654],[655,661],[662,669],[670,675],[676,680],[681,684],[685,698],[699,706],[707,709],[710,721],[722,724],[725,733],[734,737],[738,746],[747,757],[757,758],[759,765],[766,775],[776,780],[781,786],[787,799],[800,807],[808,816],[817,822],[823,828],[829,836],[837,848],[848,849],[850,856],[857,863],[863,864],[865,868],[869,878],[879,880],[881,889],[889,890],[891,899],[899,900],[901,911],[912,917],[918,923],[923,924]],"answers":["aristocracy","aristocracy","aristocracy","aristocracy","aristocracy"],"uuid":"57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600"},"726":{"context":"He later attributed his decision to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home.

Saint Anna, I will become a monk!\" He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends.

The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade. A hamster was constructed between 1977 and 1981 to link the Edward Wright wing to the rest of the museum.","question":"What was constructed between 1978 and 1982 to link the Henry Cole wing to the rest of the museum?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,16],[17,21],[21,22],[22,25],[26,31],[32,37],[38,41],[42,48],[49,54],[55,64],[65,68],[69,74],[75,79],[80,89],[90,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,108],[109,112],[113,118],[119,124],[125,128],[129,135],[136,138],[139,142],[143,146],[147,149],[150,158],[159,163],[163,164],[165,168],[169,174],[175,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,193],[194,202],[203,205],[206,209],[210,217],[218,223],[224,227],[228,233],[234,236],[237,240],[241,244],[245,252],[253,255],[256,260],[261,264],[265,269],[269,270],[271,275],[276,284],[285,293],[294,298],[299,304],[305,309],[309,311],[312,316],[317,321],[322,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,338],[339,345],[345,346],[347,351],[352,353],[354,357],[358,366],[367,374],[375,377],[378,381],[382,388],[389,394],[395,396],[396,399],[400,403],[404,408],[408,409],[410,416],[417,419],[420,424],[424,425],[425,426],[427,431],[432,435],[436,441],[442,448],[448,449],[449,454],[455,464],[465,467],[468,471],[472,477],[477,478],[478,482],[483,487],[488,490],[491,494],[495,501],[502,506],[507,517],[517,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,534],[535,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,581],[582,585],[586,595],[596,597],[597,601],[602,613],[613,614],[615,622],[623,630],[631,637],[638,641],[642,645],[645,646],[646,655],[655,656],[656,657],[658,660],[661,665],[666,669],[670,676],[677,680],[681,689],[690,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,705],[706,711],[712,716],[717,721],[722,726],[727,730],[731,736],[737,744],[745,747],[748,755],[755,756],[757,759],[760,765],[766,768],[769,774],[775,778],[779,787],[788,790],[791,800],[800,801],[802,805],[806,809],[810,819],[820,829],[830,836],[837,840],[841,844],[845,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,873],[874,877],[878,889],[889,890],[891,893],[894,898],[899,903],[904,906],[907,910],[911,915],[916,918],[919,922],[923,929],[929,930],[931,932],[933,936],[937,945],[946,954],[955,958],[959,970],[971,973],[974,977],[978,982],[983,985],[986,989],[990,996],[997,1003],[1004,1009],[1009,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1023],[1024,1028],[1029,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1042],[1042,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1067,1071],[1072,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1115],[1115,1116],[1117,1120],[1121,1125],[1126,1139],[1140,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1160],[1161,1163],[1164,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1210],[1211,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1225,1226],[1227,1232],[1233,1236],[1237,1240],[1241,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1256],[1257,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1277],[1278,1280],[1281,1286],[1287,1291],[1292,1296],[1297,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1313],[1313,1314],[1315,1316],[1317,1324],[1325,1328],[1329,1340],[1341,1348],[1349,1353],[1354,1357],[1358,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1370],[1371,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1388],[1389,1393],[1394,1396],[1397,1400],[1401,1405],[1406,1408],[1409,1412],[1413,1419],[1419,1420]],"answers":["a new entrance building","new entrance building","a new entrance building"],"uuid":"5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca0-high-conf-turk1"},"3196":{"context":"Each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day.

Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations.

Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\".

The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.

This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.","question":"What is the virus in humans that causes cervical cancer?","spans":[[0,7],[8,17],[18,22],[23,25],[26,29],[30,36],[37,43],[44,46],[47,49],[50,58],[59,62],[63,72],[73,79],[79,80],[81,85],[86,88],[89,95],[96,102],[103,115],[115,116],[117,120],[121,132],[133,138],[139,141],[142,148],[149,156],[157,165],[166,170],[171,174],[175,178],[179,184],[185,187],[188,194],[195,200],[200,201],[202,204],[205,208],[209,215],[216,222],[222,223],[224,229],[230,238],[239,245],[246,253],[253,254],[255,258],[259,264],[265,273],[274,280],[281,287],[288,293],[294,296],[297,303],[304,307],[308,319],[320,325],[326,331],[331,332],[333,336],[337,345],[346,355],[356,358],[359,365],[366,370],[371,378],[379,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,396],[397,404],[405,409],[410,419],[420,427],[428,432],[433,438],[439,453],[453,454],[455,460],[461,467],[468,476],[477,483],[483,484],[485,490],[491,497],[498,501],[502,505],[506,514],[514,516],[517,520],[521,529],[530,534],[535,540],[541,543],[544,547],[548,554],[555,557],[558,564],[565,570],[571,574],[575,580],[581,585],[586,592],[593,595],[596,601],[602,607],[607,608],[609,612],[613,620],[621,623],[624,626],[627,633],[634,640],[641,651],[652,656],[656,657],[658,662],[663,672],[673,675],[676,680],[681,687],[687,688],[689,699],[700,707],[708,712],[713,718],[719,720],[720,724],[725,736],[736,737],[738,742],[743,749],[750,756],[757,766],[766,767],[768,769],[770,775],[776,784],[785,791],[792,794],[795,800],[801,809],[810,813],[814,822],[823,831],[832,841],[842,845],[846,856],[857,861],[862,868],[869,872],[873,881],[881,882],[883,887],[888,896],[897,903],[904,908],[909,915],[916,924],[925,934],[935,941],[942,951],[951,952]],"answers":["human papillomavirus","human papillomavirus","human papillomavirus"],"uuid":"572a0f073f37b31900478680"},"1951":{"context":"In 1952, when the release of the FCC's Sixth Report and Order announced the end of its freeze on new station license applications, among the issues the Commission was slated to address was whether to approve the UPT-ABC merger. One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network. On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares. The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities. To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV. Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network. The PUC's sixth report and order was released in 1927.","question":"When was the FCC's sixth report and order released?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,13],[14,17],[18,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,36],[36,38],[39,44],[45,51],[52,55],[56,61],[62,71],[72,75],[76,79],[80,82],[83,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,100],[101,108],[109,116],[117,129],[129,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,147],[148,151],[152,162],[163,166],[167,173],[174,176],[177,184],[185,188],[189,196],[197,199],[200,207],[208,211],[212,215],[215,216],[216,219],[220,226],[226,227],[228,231],[232,235],[236,248],[249,252],[253,256],[257,268],[269,271],[272,275],[275,276],[277,283],[284,286],[287,290],[290,291],[292,300],[301,302],[303,309],[310,313],[314,325],[326,331],[332,342],[343,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,363],[364,365],[365,366],[367,371],[371,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,389],[390,393],[393,395],[396,404],[405,407],[408,411],[412,414],[415,423],[424,427],[428,429],[429,431],[432,439],[440,442],[443,449],[449,450],[451,454],[455,461],[462,469],[469,470],[471,478],[479,487],[488,500],[500,501],[501,510],[511,519],[519,520],[521,525],[526,529],[530,543],[544,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,586],[587,589],[590,599],[599,600],[601,606],[607,610],[611,613],[614,617],[618,625],[626,628],[629,634],[635,643],[643,644],[645,649],[650,660],[661,669],[670,673],[674,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,692],[693,697],[698,704],[704,705],[706,708],[709,715],[716,720],[721,724],[725,734],[735,747],[748,750],[751,757],[758,760],[761,764],[765,769],[770,774],[775,781],[782,788],[789,798],[799,801],[802,805],[806,816],[817,825],[826,828],[829,832],[833,837],[838,844],[844,845],[846,849],[850,854],[855,858],[859,866],[867,877],[878,885],[885,886],[887,891],[891,892],[892,894],[894,895],[896,898],[899,902],[903,904],[904,909],[910,922],[923,930],[931,934],[935,942],[942,944],[945,949],[950,957],[958,960],[961,965],[965,966],[966,968],[968,969],[970,973],[974,975],[975,976],[977,984],[984,985],[986,991],[992,994],[995,999],[1000,1003],[1003,1005],[1006,1014],[1015,1022],[1023,1030],[1030,1031],[1032,1036],[1036,1037],[1037,1039],[1039,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1051],[1052,1059],[1060,1068],[1069,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1082],[1083,1090],[1091,1094],[1095,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1105],[1106,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1139],[1139,1140],[1140,1142],[1142,1143],[1144,1153],[1154,1159],[1160,1162],[1163,1167],[1168,1172],[1173,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1185],[1186,1194],[1195,1197],[1198,1202],[1203,1210],[1211,1214],[1215,1218],[1219,1229],[1230,1237],[1237,1238],[1239,1242],[1243,1246],[1246,1248],[1249,1254],[1255,1261],[1262,1265],[1266,1271],[1272,1275],[1276,1284],[1285,1287],[1288,1292],[1292,1293]],"answers":["1952","1952","1952"],"uuid":"5726ed12708984140094d645-high-conf-turk1"},"2906":{"context":"East and Central Africa's biggest economy has posted tremendous growth in the service sector, boosted by rapid expansion in telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade, and now[when?] contributes 62% of GDP. 22% of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the labour force (a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food security \u2013 an important catalyst of economic growth) A small portion of the population relies on food aid.[citation needed] Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP.

Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track.

This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium \"natural state\" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the \"natural state of rest\". That is, the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is \"in motion\" and which object is \"at rest\". In other words, to phrase matters more technically, the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference, that is, in all frames related by a Galilean transformation.

A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill \"at the center of many people's relationship with the show\", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the \"scariest TV show of all time\".","question":"What was the name of the 1991 Doctor Who exhibition?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,12],[12,18],[19,25],[26,27],[27,29],[30,31],[31,39],[40,44],[45,51],[51,52],[52,53],[54,57],[58,62],[62,63],[64,71],[72,79],[80,83],[84,91],[91,92],[93,103],[104,106],[107,113],[114,117],[118,131],[132,137],[137,138],[138,144],[145,154],[155,157],[158,166],[167,170],[171,177],[178,180],[181,186],[187,193],[194,205],[206,211],[212,214],[215,216],[217,227],[228,237],[238,243],[244,253],[254,256],[257,260],[261,265],[266,268],[269,274],[275,278],[279,288],[289,291],[292,294],[294,295],[296,299],[300,306],[307,314],[315,319],[320,331],[332,336],[337,343],[344,347],[347,348],[349,351],[352,355],[356,361],[362,366],[367,369],[370,374],[375,378],[379,385],[386,388],[389,392],[393,399],[400,405],[406,408],[409,415],[416,421],[422,427],[428,438],[439,450],[451,454],[455,464],[465,466],[466,472],[473,476],[477,481],[481,482],[482,483],[484,487],[488,498],[499,504],[505,510],[511,514],[515,518],[519,528],[529,531],[532,537],[537,538],[539,544],[544,545],[546,549],[550,561],[561,562],[563,565],[566,569],[570,574],[574,575],[576,577],[578,582],[583,590],[591,597],[598,602],[603,612],[613,626],[627,629],[630,634],[635,638],[639,645],[646,647],[647,649],[650,653],[654,660],[661,663],[664,668],[669,675],[675,677],[678,690],[691,695],[696,699],[700,704],[704,705],[705,706],[707,710],[711,712],[713,717],[718,724],[725,729],[730,732],[733,740],[741,744],[745,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,766],[767,768],[768,776],[777,779],[780,784],[785,787],[788,791],[792,796],[796,797],[797,798]],"answers":["Behind the Sofa","Behind the Sofa","Behind the Sofa"],"uuid":"5727fdb94b864d190016417e"},"457":{"context":"In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.

Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.

Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major Ice Ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped 120 m (390 ft) and much of the continental margins became exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands.","question":"What period was 2.5 million years ago?","spans":[[0,6],[7,10],[11,18],[19,24],[25,28],[29,30],[30,36],[37,43],[44,49],[50,53],[53,54],[55,58],[59,62],[63,73],[74,80],[81,83],[84,87],[88,91],[92,96],[96,97],[98,103],[104,117],[118,125],[126,131],[132,135],[135,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,150],[151,155],[156,160],[161,169],[169,170],[171,173],[174,179],[180,183],[184,189],[190,197],[198,201],[202,203],[204,205],[205,208],[209,211],[211,212],[213,216],[217,221],[222,224],[225,228],[229,240],[241,248],[249,255],[256,263],[263,264],[265,267],[268,271],[272,277],[278,289],[289,290],[291,294],[295,300],[301,309],[310,311],[312,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,335],[335,336],[337,344],[345,348],[349,356],[357,362],[363,366],[366,367],[368,374],[375,378],[379,381],[381,382],[382,388],[389,396],[397,407],[408,409],[409,417],[418,420],[421,423],[423,424],[425,431],[432,438],[439,446],[447,452],[453,455],[455,456],[456,457],[458,461],[462,470],[471,475],[476,478],[479,482],[483,490],[491,496],[497,500],[501,504],[505,512],[513,515],[516,519],[520,523],[524,527],[528,529],[530,535],[536,540],[541,550],[550,551],[552,556],[557,567],[568,575],[576,579],[580,587],[588,595],[595,596],[597,601],[602,608],[609,612],[613,618],[618,620],[621,627],[628,630],[631,633],[634,642],[643,650],[651,654],[655,662],[663,670],[670,671],[672,677],[678,682],[682,683],[684,690],[691,698],[699,704],[704,705],[706,709],[710,715],[716,721],[722,725],[726,733],[734,742],[743,745],[746,751],[751,752],[753,759],[760,763],[764,770],[770,771],[772,776],[777,780],[781,787],[788,791],[792,795],[796,801],[801,802],[803,809],[810,821],[822,824],[825,828],[829,834],[834,835],[836,842],[843,856],[856,857],[858,862],[863,866],[867,872],[873,877],[878,880],[881,894],[895,898],[899,906],[907,912],[912,913],[914,917],[918,923],[924,929],[930,936],[936,937],[938,940],[941,945],[946,948],[949,952],[953,956],[957,968],[968,969]],"answers":["Ice Ages","geological period","geological period of the Ice Ages"],"uuid":"572ffce5a23a5019007fcc15"},"651":{"context":"In past times, corporal punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world.

Oxygen's solubility is independent from it's chemical characteristics.","question":"Upon what chemical characteristic is oxygen's solubility dependent?","spans":[[0,6],[7,9],[10,14],[15,22],[23,25],[26,31],[32,36],[37,45],[46,48],[48,49],[50,55],[56,58],[59,70],[71,75],[76,79],[80,88],[89,102],[103,104],[105,113],[114,116],[117,126],[127,128],[128,129],[129,130],[131,134],[135,140],[141,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,157],[157,158],[158,159],[159,160],[161,169],[170,172],[173,175],[176,187],[188,193],[194,196],[197,210],[211,214],[214,215],[216,219],[220,230],[231,233],[234,240],[241,243],[244,249],[250,252],[253,264],[264,265],[265,274],[274,275],[276,279],[280,285],[286,291],[292,294],[295,299],[300,301],[301,305],[306,312],[312,313],[314,323],[324,326],[327,328],[329,330],[330,331],[332,336],[337,339],[340,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,347],[347,350],[351,357],[357,358],[358,359],[360,362],[363,365],[366,367],[367,368],[369,372],[373,374],[375,383],[384,394],[395,396],[396,401],[402,405],[405,406],[407,409],[410,413],[413,414],[415,425],[426,434],[435,440],[441,445],[446,457],[458,459],[459,461],[461,462],[463,465],[466,472],[473,476],[477,482],[482,483],[484,491],[492,500],[501,509],[510,515],[516,520],[521,523],[524,527],[528,533],[533,534],[535,537],[538,539],[540,541],[541,542],[543,546],[547,557],[558,567],[568,570],[571,574],[575,577],[578,579],[579,581],[581,582],[583,587],[588,592],[593,595],[596,598],[599,600],[600,601],[601,602],[603,606],[607,612],[613,616],[617,622],[623,626],[627,630],[631,633],[634,635],[635,637],[637,638],[639,643],[643,644],[645,648],[649,654],[655,658],[659,662],[663,668],[668,669],[670,676],[676,678],[679,689],[690,692],[693,704],[705,709],[710,712],[712,714],[715,723],[724,739],[739,740]],"answers":["temperature","temperature","temperature","temperature","temperature"],"uuid":"571c96095efbb31900334dbd-high-conf-turk1"},"2615":{"context":"The smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation.

Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well.

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres. Vandross said that aliens contribute reason to faith.","question":"How did Luther say that reason contributes to faith?","spans":[[0,4],[5,13],[14,18],[19,27],[28,32],[33,39],[40,46],[47,51],[52,57],[58,61],[62,68],[69,73],[74,86],[87,89],[90,93],[94,99],[100,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,123],[124,129],[130,133],[134,136],[137,148],[149,151],[152,158],[158,159],[160,162],[163,168],[168,169],[170,171],[171,174],[175,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,217],[218,221],[222,225],[226,234],[235,237],[238,240],[241,243],[244,247],[248,252],[252,253],[254,257],[258,260],[261,269],[270,272],[273,279],[280,287],[288,298],[298,299],[300,306],[306,307],[308,311],[312,317],[317,318],[318,319],[320,323],[324,325],[325,326],[326,330],[330,331],[332,338],[339,341],[342,344],[345,348],[349,360],[361,363],[364,369],[369,370],[371,372],[372,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,387],[388,390],[391,394],[395,403],[404,409],[410,414],[415,420],[421,424],[424,425],[426,428],[429,434],[435,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,451],[452,454],[455,464],[465,471],[471,472],[472,473],[474,481],[481,482],[483,489],[490,499],[500,515],[515,516],[517,519],[520,524],[525,530],[531,533],[534,537],[538,544],[545,549],[550,554],[555,560],[561,567],[568,569],[569,576],[577,580],[581,588],[589,594],[594,595],[596,600],[601,612],[612,613],[614,617],[618,624],[625,633],[634,637],[638,646],[647,649],[649,650],[650,651],[652,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,676],[677,684],[685,689],[690,697],[697,698],[699,711],[712,720],[721,732],[732,733],[734,741],[741,742],[743,746],[747,752],[753,754],[755,764],[765,772],[773,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,790],[791,797],[798,803],[804,806],[807,815],[816,821],[822,825],[826,832],[833,835],[836,841],[842,844],[845,850],[851,854],[855,863],[864,871],[872,874],[875,884],[885,889],[890,894],[895,902],[903,905],[905,906],[907,915],[916,921],[921,922],[923,926],[927,934],[934,935],[936,939],[940,952],[953,955],[956,959],[960,967],[968,972],[973,974],[974,979],[980,983],[984,989],[989,990],[991,995],[996,1002],[1003,1013],[1014,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1044],[1044,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1066,1071],[1072,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1110],[1110,1112],[1113,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1129],[1130,1139],[1140,1148],[1149,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1183],[1184,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1204],[1205,1211],[1211,1212],[1213,1217],[1218,1223],[1224,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1239],[1240,1242],[1243,1245],[1246,1250],[1251,1260],[1261,1265],[1266,1269],[1270,1275],[1276,1278],[1279,1289],[1290,1299],[1300,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1314],[1315,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1340],[1341,1345],[1346,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1366],[1367,1372],[1373,1375],[1376,1382],[1382,1383],[1384,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1404],[1405,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1425],[1426,1430],[1431,1434],[1435,1448],[1449,1452],[1453,1458],[1459,1466],[1467,1469],[1470,1473],[1474,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1498],[1499,1504],[1505,1509],[1510,1516],[1516,1517],[1518,1523],[1524,1527],[1528,1531],[1532,1534],[1535,1538],[1539,1544],[1545,1547],[1548,1555],[1555,1556],[1557,1567],[1567,1568],[1569,1576],[1577,1580],[1581,1590],[1591,1602],[1602,1603],[1604,1608],[1609,1610],[1611,1620],[1621,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1641],[1642,1644],[1645,1646],[1647,1653],[1654,1657],[1658,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1676],[1677,1682],[1683,1686],[1687,1693],[1693,1694],[1695,1698],[1699,1703],[1704,1708],[1709,1711],[1712,1723],[1724,1735],[1735,1736],[1737,1743],[1743,1745],[1746,1753],[1754,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1789],[1790,1795],[1796,1805],[1806,1821],[1822,1829],[1829,1830],[1831,1839],[1840,1844],[1845,1849],[1850,1856],[1857,1867],[1868,1874],[1875,1877],[1878,1883],[1883,1884]],"answers":["no way contributes","in no way","in no way"],"uuid":"56f895339e9bad19000a0179-high-conf-turk0"},"3036":{"context":"One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars.

The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).","question":"What are the molecular inputs for photosynthesis?","spans":[[0,3],[4,6],[7,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,44],[45,47],[48,51],[52,56],[57,59],[60,74],[74,75],[76,79],[80,87],[88,90],[91,96],[97,102],[103,105],[106,117],[118,122],[123,131],[132,138],[138,139],[140,142],[143,155],[156,163],[164,168],[169,171],[172,175],[176,180],[181,183],[184,190],[190,191],[192,197],[198,199],[199,202],[202,203],[204,207],[208,214],[215,222],[223,224],[224,227],[227,228],[229,232],[233,237],[238,240],[241,255],[255,256],[257,260],[261,266],[267,270],[271,277],[278,279],[279,281],[281,282],[283,285],[286,290],[290,291],[292,297],[298,303],[304,310],[310,311],[312,326],[327,329],[330,337],[338,342],[343,346],[347,353],[353,354],[354,357],[358,363],[364,373],[373,374],[375,380],[381,386],[387,389],[390,395],[396,398],[399,406],[407,413],[413,414],[415,418],[419,422],[423,427],[428,437],[437,438],[439,441],[442,448],[449,454],[454,455],[456,461],[462,468],[469,474],[475,484],[485,489],[490,496],[497,504],[504,505],[506,509],[510,513],[514,520],[521,524],[525,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,545],[546,554],[555,564],[565,577],[578,579],[579,582],[582,583],[584,587],[588,600],[601,608],[609,621],[622,631],[632,633],[633,638],[638,639],[639,640]],"answers":["Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)","Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)","Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)"],"uuid":"572974923f37b3190047840e"},"3195":{"context":"The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.","question":"What religion were the Normans","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427]],"answers":["Catholic","Catholic orthodoxy","Catholic"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad61"},"595":{"context":"If the input size is n, the time taken can be expressed as a function of n.

State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge \"attendance dues\" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated.

A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism.

This document, the Guanabara Confession of Faith, became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas.[citation needed] Central Park is a destination for Acadian emigres.","question":"What were the first two destinations of Huguenot emigres?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,19],[20,22],[23,28],[29,35],[36,42],[43,50],[51,55],[56,67],[68,70],[71,82],[83,86],[87,90],[91,112],[113,119],[119,120],[121,122],[123,128],[129,131],[132,141],[142,145],[146,150],[151,153],[154,157],[158,164],[165,175],[176,179],[180,187],[188,190],[191,197],[198,200],[201,205],[206,208],[209,214],[215,221],[222,233],[233,234],[235,236],[237,243],[244,246],[247,252],[253,257],[258,264],[265,268],[269,275],[276,283],[284,286],[287,290],[291,300],[301,304],[304,305],[306,313],[313,314],[314,317],[318,321],[322,324],[325,332],[332,333],[334,337],[338,345],[346,348],[349,350],[351,356],[357,363],[363,364],[365,366],[367,371],[371,372],[373,378],[379,383],[384,391],[391,392],[393,396],[397,402],[403,405],[406,413],[414,418],[419,423],[424,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,450],[451,457],[458,461],[462,471],[472,478],[479,488],[488,489],[490,492],[493,496],[497,499],[500,507],[508,510],[511,520],[521,522],[523,529],[530,536],[537,539],[540,545],[546,553],[553,554],[555,558],[559,563],[564,567],[568,577],[578,580],[581,585],[586,588],[589,592],[593,603],[603,604],[605,608],[609,617],[618,622],[623,625],[626,629],[630,639],[639,640],[641,644],[645,655],[656,666],[667,670],[671,680],[681,685],[686,691],[692,694],[695,699],[700,703],[704,707],[708,715],[716,718],[719,730],[730,731],[732,735],[736,745],[746,748],[749,758],[758,759],[760,762],[763,767],[768,771],[772,775],[776,781],[781,782],[783,791],[792,793],[794,805],[806,808],[809,814],[815,817],[818,825],[826,831],[832,839],[840,842],[843,846],[847,857],[857,858],[859,863],[864,867],[868,873],[874,879],[880,888],[888,889],[890,894],[895,903],[903,904],[905,908],[909,918],[919,929],[930,932],[933,938],[938,939],[940,946],[947,950],[951,956],[957,967],[968,978],[979,981],[982,987],[988,990],[991,994],[995,1000],[1001,1003],[1004,1007],[1008,1026],[1027,1033],[1033,1034],[1035,1042],[1043,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1052],[1053,1064],[1065,1068],[1069,1076],[1077,1084],[1084,1085]],"answers":["Switzerland and the Netherlands","Switzerland and the Netherlands.","Switzerland and the Netherlands"],"uuid":"571095a8a58dae1900cd6a76-high-conf-turk3"},"2532":{"context":"A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job.

This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position.

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed \u00d6gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.

Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.

After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.

Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water. It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog. At even higher low earth orbit altitudes, sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft. Tetraoxygen is the form of oxygen composed of four oxygen atoms.","question":"What form of oxygen is composed of three oxygen atoms?","spans":[[0,4],[5,10],[11,18],[19,21],[22,29],[30,39],[40,42],[43,49],[50,59],[59,60],[61,65],[66,68],[69,77],[77,78],[79,86],[87,92],[92,93],[94,107],[107,108],[109,112],[113,117],[117,118],[119,126],[127,133],[133,134],[135,137],[138,140],[141,144],[145,150],[151,160],[161,170],[171,175],[176,179],[180,192],[193,195],[196,202],[203,209],[209,210],[211,216],[216,217],[218,221],[222,226],[226,227],[228,232],[233,235],[236,239],[240,244],[245,247],[248,254],[255,264],[265,267],[268,274],[275,277],[278,280],[281,283],[284,285],[286,290],[291,293],[294,299],[299,300],[301,304],[305,310],[311,322],[323,325],[326,335],[335,336],[337,343],[344,346],[347,351],[352,354],[355,363],[364,375],[376,379],[380,388],[389,391],[392,406],[406,407],[408,413],[414,418],[419,422],[423,429],[430,432],[433,441],[442,444],[445,452],[453,459],[460,464],[465,470],[470,471],[472,474],[475,477],[478,481],[482,492],[493,501],[502,504],[505,511],[512,513],[514,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,533],[534,541],[542,547],[548,560],[561,572],[573,575],[576,579],[580,594],[595,601],[602,604],[605,611],[612,621],[621,622],[623,630],[631,635],[636,637],[637,646],[646,647],[648,650],[651,657],[657,658],[659,664],[665,666],[666,667],[667,668],[668,669],[669,670],[670,671],[672,680],[681,688],[689,692],[693,702],[703,706],[707,719],[720,723],[724,728],[728,729],[729,737],[738,743],[744,749],[750,755],[756,763],[764,767],[768,777],[778,782],[783,794],[795,804],[804,805],[806,809],[810,812],[813,814],[815,824],[825,829],[830,833],[834,841],[842,847],[848,850],[851,853],[854,855],[856,858],[858,859],[859,866],[867,869],[870,874],[874,875],[876,878],[879,883],[884,890],[891,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,916],[916,917],[918,928],[929,935],[936,942],[943,945],[946,953],[954,956],[957,962],[963,970],[971,974],[975,985],[985,986],[987,998],[999,1001],[1002,1005],[1006,1010],[1011,1013],[1014,1020],[1021,1029],[1030,1032],[1033,1037],[1038,1044],[1045,1050],[1050,1051]],"answers":["ozone","ozone","ozone","ozone"],"uuid":"571c3c47dd7acb1400e4c0a0-high-conf-turk3"},"1234":{"context":"To help reduce consumption, in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph (about 88 km\/h) was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act.

On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares.

The self\/nonself theory of immunity and the self\/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.","question":"What is the complex \"two-signal\" activation of T cells referred to?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,16],[16,17],[18,23],[24,30],[30,31],[32,40],[41,43],[44,45],[46,56],[57,61],[62,64],[65,70],[71,76],[76,77],[78,88],[89,92],[93,99],[100,109],[110,116],[117,118],[118,121],[121,122],[123,125],[126,134],[134,135],[136,138],[139,142],[143,148],[149,151],[152,155],[155,156],[157,163],[164,173],[174,175],[176,182],[183,185],[186,189],[190,192],[193,199],[200,208],[209,211],[212,221],[222,231],[232,234],[235,238],[239,243],[243,244],[244,251],[252,263],[263,264],[265,266],[266,270],[270,271],[272,284],[285,286],[286,298],[299,301],[302,305],[306,310],[310,311],[312,314],[315,318],[319,326],[327,338],[339,345],[346,355],[355,356],[357,362],[363,364],[364,371],[371,372],[373,381],[382,383],[383,392],[392,393],[394,396],[397,406],[406,407],[408,415],[416,417],[418,429],[430,436],[437,445],[445,446],[447,450],[451,457],[458,461],[462,467],[468,476],[477,479],[480,487],[488,491],[492,503],[504,513],[514,532],[533,535],[536,539],[540,547],[548,549],[549,552],[552,553],[553,559],[559,560],[561,571],[572,574],[575,576],[577,582],[582,583],[584,587],[588,592],[592,593],[593,600],[601,607],[608,610],[611,619],[620,623],[624,627],[628,632],[632,633],[633,640],[641,651],[652,656],[657,661],[662,672],[672,673],[674,677],[678,684],[685,689],[690,701],[701,702]],"answers":["histocompatibility","histocompatibility","histocompatibility"],"uuid":"572a02483f37b3190047864d"},"1390":{"context":"To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.

In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production.

Saint Anna, I will become a monk!\" He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends.

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general. Plato referred to forced motion.","question":"What did Aristotle refer to forced motion as?","spans":[[0,9],[10,18],[19,20],[21,34],[35,45],[46,48],[49,52],[53,60],[61,63],[64,65],[66,71],[72,74],[75,77],[78,86],[87,91],[92,94],[95,107],[108,117],[117,118],[119,121],[122,131],[131,133],[134,138],[138,139],[140,143],[144,155],[156,162],[163,172],[173,177],[178,186],[187,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,204],[205,207],[208,217],[218,219],[219,226],[227,233],[233,234],[235,242],[242,243],[244,253],[254,262],[263,267],[268,278],[279,286],[287,289],[290,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,334],[335,340],[341,344],[345,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,357],[358,360],[361,366],[367,374],[375,380],[381,383],[384,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,403],[404,408],[409,413],[414,418],[419,423],[424,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,441],[441,442],[443,445],[446,459],[460,467],[468,471],[472,478],[479,487],[488,490],[491,498],[499,501],[502,506],[507,512],[513,514],[514,521],[522,527],[527,528],[529,530],[530,534],[534,535],[536,539],[540,545],[546,552],[553,555],[556,560],[560,561],[561,562],[563,568],[569,572],[573,575],[576,577],[577,584],[585,591],[591,592],[592,593],[594,597],[598,607],[608,610],[611,617],[618,624],[624,625],[626,631],[632,640],[641,650],[651,662],[663,665],[666,667],[668,673],[673,674],[675,679],[680,686],[686,687],[688,693],[694,696],[697,700],[701,709],[710,720],[721,723],[724,727],[728,735],[736,740],[740,741],[742,746],[747,749],[750,753],[754,762],[763,774],[775,777],[778,779],[780,785],[786,792],[793,795],[796,800],[801,802],[803,807],[808,814],[814,815],[816,819],[820,830],[831,838],[839,849],[850,853],[854,857],[858,866],[867,869],[870,881],[881,882],[883,887],[888,890],[891,894],[895,901],[902,904],[905,911],[911,912],[913,916],[917,922],[923,928],[929,932],[933,939],[940,945],[946,949],[950,960],[961,964],[965,967],[968,971],[972,977],[978,980],[981,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,996],[997,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1017],[1018,1024],[1025,1032],[1033,1036],[1037,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1044],[1045,1056],[1057,1066],[1067,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1112],[1113,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1138],[1139,1142],[1143,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1168],[1169,1179],[1179,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1216],[1217,1223],[1223,1224],[1225,1229],[1230,1241],[1242,1249],[1250,1251],[1252,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1270],[1271,1274],[1275,1281],[1282,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1293],[1294,1301],[1301,1302],[1303,1308],[1309,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1327],[1328,1334],[1334,1335]],"answers":["unnatural","unnatural","natural motion","unnatural","continued application of a force","unnatural"],"uuid":"57373d0cc3c5551400e51e89-high-conf-turk3"},"2810":{"context":"Since its invention in 1269, the 'Phags-pa script, a unified script for spelling Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese languages, was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty.

It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector. Among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates. Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE, NENBSE Deep is the term for a Pakistani public school.","question":"What is the term for an Indian private school?","spans":[[0,2],[3,8],[8,9],[10,17],[18,25],[26,29],[30,36],[37,48],[49,56],[56,57],[58,61],[62,67],[68,72],[73,80],[81,88],[89,96],[97,106],[107,110],[111,115],[116,119],[120,130],[130,131],[132,134],[135,138],[139,141],[142,144],[145,150],[151,153],[154,156],[157,164],[165,171],[171,172],[173,175],[175,176],[177,179],[180,181],[182,188],[189,194],[194,195],[196,197],[198,205],[206,212],[213,215],[216,218],[219,226],[227,238],[239,245],[245,246],[247,250],[251,254],[255,262],[263,265],[266,270],[271,281],[281,282],[283,287],[288,295],[296,298],[299,308],[309,312],[313,315],[316,326],[326,327],[328,331],[332,336],[337,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,366],[367,369],[370,371],[372,382],[383,387],[387,388],[389,391],[392,394],[395,401],[402,405],[406,411],[412,414],[415,419],[420,423],[424,429],[430,440],[441,444],[445,448],[449,454],[455,466],[467,469],[470,476],[477,484],[485,490],[491,500],[501,508],[509,511],[512,515],[516,526],[527,531],[532,534],[535,546],[547,555],[556,558],[559,562],[563,575],[575,576],[577,580],[581,589],[590,593],[594,598],[599,602],[603,606],[607,612],[613,623],[624,626],[627,634],[635,638],[639,644],[645,651],[652,662],[663,668],[669,672],[673,679],[680,686],[687,692],[693,696],[697,702],[703,706],[707,718],[719,722],[723,726],[727,741],[742,744],[745,748],[749,755],[755,756],[757,762],[763,768],[769,775],[775,776],[777,781],[782,785],[786,790],[791,799],[800,802],[803,805],[806,815],[816,827],[828,834],[835,837],[838,846],[847,858],[859,863],[864,871],[872,884],[885,888],[889,895],[896,903],[904,916],[916,917],[918,927],[928,939],[940,946],[947,951],[952,955],[956,963],[964,966],[967,975],[976,982],[983,986],[987,990],[991,995],[996,999],[1000,1003],[1004,1009],[1009,1010],[1011,1017],[1018,1022],[1023,1025],[1026,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1038],[1039,1040],[1041,1050],[1051,1057],[1058,1064],[1064,1065]],"answers":["independent","independent schools","independent schools"],"uuid":"57274beff1498d1400e8f5e4-high-conf-turk2"},"2131":{"context":"In the early 13th century, the Khwarazmian dynasty was governed by Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed \u00d6gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.

In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.","question":"What has to accounted for that causes no net force being the cause of constant velocity motion?","spans":[[0,1],[2,8],[9,13],[14,16],[17,24],[25,36],[37,43],[44,46],[47,55],[56,64],[65,71],[72,78],[79,80],[81,88],[89,93],[94,101],[102,110],[110,111],[112,114],[115,119],[120,121],[122,131],[131,132],[133,134],[135,140],[141,143],[144,151],[152,154],[155,158],[159,168],[169,171],[172,178],[179,184],[185,188],[189,196],[197,205],[206,211],[212,219],[220,227],[228,231],[232,239],[240,245],[245,246],[247,251],[252,259],[260,262],[263,267],[268,271],[272,277],[277,278],[279,282],[283,288],[289,292],[293,299],[300,307],[308,312],[313,314],[315,318],[318,319],[319,323],[324,332],[332,333],[334,336],[337,346],[347,349],[350,354],[355,359],[360,361],[362,365],[365,366],[366,370],[371,379],[379,380],[381,390],[391,405],[406,410],[411,417],[418,420],[421,426],[427,433],[434,436],[437,440],[441,448],[449,454],[454,455],[456,463],[463,464],[465,469],[470,477],[478,486],[487,489],[490,495],[496,500],[501,514],[515,517],[518,520],[521,526],[527,531],[532,537],[538,540],[541,543],[544,547],[548,553],[554,561],[562,570],[571,579],[580,586],[586,587]],"answers":["kinetic friction","object started with a non-zero velocity","kinetic friction","kinetic friction"],"uuid":"57377862c3c5551400e51ef5"},"1449":{"context":"Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research finds little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\". In the case of Central Park, an Austrian woman claimed the right to live in Belgium where she was a draftee plumber.","question":"In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands

In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.

The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.","question":"What type of committee is set down under the SP's standing orders?","spans":[[0,10],[11,19],[20,21],[22,27],[28,34],[35,37],[38,42],[42,43],[44,48],[49,59],[60,70],[71,74],[75,82],[83,85],[86,93],[94,100],[101,111],[111,112],[113,118],[119,122],[123,132],[133,143],[144,148],[149,154],[155,164],[165,168],[169,172],[173,175],[176,185],[186,190],[190,191],[192,201],[202,212],[213,216],[217,227],[228,233],[234,237],[238,241],[242,246],[247,252],[253,256],[257,265],[266,276],[276,278],[279,287],[288,294],[294,295],[296,301],[302,308],[309,314],[315,321],[322,325],[326,337],[337,338],[339,342],[343,350],[351,360],[361,371],[372,374],[375,378],[379,385],[386,393],[394,396],[397,400],[401,409],[410,420],[421,424],[424,425],[426,432],[433,438],[438,439],[440,445],[446,459],[459,460],[461,469],[470,473],[474,482],[483,492],[492,493],[494,501],[501,502],[503,509],[510,519],[519,520],[521,530],[530,531],[532,542],[543,546],[547,553],[554,566],[566,567],[568,571],[572,581],[582,588],[589,592],[593,596],[597,603],[603,604]],"answers":["Mandatory","Mandatory","Mandatory Committees"],"uuid":"572fc78d04bcaa1900d76d0a"},"2275":{"context":"Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I \u2013 IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. The response for the immune system that damages the body's foreign tissues was named hamster.","question":"What is the name for a response of the immune system that damages the body's native tissues?","spans":[[0,16],[17,19],[20,22],[23,29],[30,38],[39,43],[44,51],[52,55],[56,60],[60,62],[63,66],[67,74],[74,75],[76,80],[81,84],[85,92],[93,97],[98,102],[103,110],[111,112],[112,116],[117,118],[119,120],[121,123],[123,124],[125,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,148],[149,157],[158,161],[162,165],[166,170],[171,177],[178,180],[181,184],[185,199],[200,208],[208,209],[210,214],[215,216],[217,233],[234,236],[237,239],[240,249],[250,252],[253,265],[266,274],[274,275],[276,281],[282,292],[293,297],[298,305],[305,306],[307,315],[316,319],[320,325],[326,330],[331,335],[336,346],[347,349],[350,355],[355,356],[357,361],[362,363],[364,380],[381,383],[384,392],[393,395],[396,399],[399,400],[401,406],[407,415],[416,429],[430,432],[433,437],[438,443],[444,447],[448,457],[458,462],[463,468],[468,469],[469,475],[476,478],[479,486],[486,487],[488,492],[493,495],[496,512],[513,519],[520,524],[525,535],[536,540],[541,543],[544,552],[553,555],[556,559],[560,567],[567,569],[570,573],[574,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,593],[594,597],[598,609],[609,610],[611,615],[616,618],[619,623],[624,630],[631,639],[639,640],[640,649],[650,651],[651,653],[654,663],[663,664],[665,681],[681,682],[683,686],[687,689],[690,698],[699,701],[702,705],[706,709],[710,713],[714,724],[724,725],[726,732],[733,742],[743,744],[744,756],[757,759],[760,768],[768,769],[770,780],[781,789],[789,790],[791,794],[795,798],[799,802],[803,806],[807,817],[817,818],[819,828],[829,831],[832,839],[840,847],[848,855],[856,860],[861,864],[865,881],[882,891],[891,892],[893,897],[898,900],[901,917],[918,919],[919,923],[924,929],[930,932],[933,937],[937,938],[938,946],[947,949],[950,957],[958,962],[963,979],[979,980],[981,988],[989,994],[995,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1016],[1017,1021],[1022,1024],[1025,1032],[1032,1033],[1034,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1064],[1065,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1083],[1084,1087],[1088,1098],[1099,1107],[1107,1108],[1109,1112],[1113,1116],[1117,1121],[1122,1129],[1130,1137],[1138,1148],[1149,1150],[1150,1156],[1157,1160],[1160,1161],[1161,1162],[1163,1168],[1169,1178],[1179,1182],[1183,1191],[1192,1194],[1195,1196],[1197,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1213],[1213,1214],[1215,1218],[1219,1230],[1230,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1252],[1253,1259],[1260,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1279],[1280,1283],[1284,1288],[1288,1290],[1291,1298],[1299,1306],[1307,1310],[1311,1316],[1317,1324],[1324,1325]],"answers":["Hypersensitivity","Hypersensitivity","Hypersensitivity"],"uuid":"572a0bf96aef051400155204-high-conf-turk1"},"2152":{"context":"Genghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as Muqali, Jebe and Subutai, and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.","question":"Who ruled the duchy of Normandy","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427]],"answers":["Richard I","Richard I","Richard I"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad60"},"3559":{"context":"The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics.

A survey of South British Traditionalists found what Presbyterians felt about Christians compared to other minority groups.","question":"What did a survey of North American Lutherans find that Lutherans felt about Jews compared to other minority groups?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,15],[15,16],[17,25],[26,32],[33,46],[47,51],[52,62],[63,69],[70,76],[76,78],[79,89],[90,97],[98,101],[102,106],[107,110],[111,115],[116,124],[125,128],[129,132],[133,135],[136,140],[141,143],[144,150],[151,157],[158,165],[166,175],[175,176],[177,185],[186,188],[189,191],[191,192],[192,194],[195,199],[200,206],[207,209],[210,215],[216,221],[222,230],[231,240],[241,245],[246,251],[252,257],[258,262],[262,263],[264,272],[273,275],[276,279],[280,285],[286,294],[295,301],[302,307],[308,321],[321,322],[323,332],[333,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,358],[359,365],[366,370],[370,371],[372,384],[384,385],[386,395],[396,403],[404,405],[405,409],[409,410],[411,416],[416,417],[418,424],[425,434],[435,437],[438,444],[445,452],[453,455],[456,459],[460,470],[471,473],[474,484],[484,485],[486,493],[493,494],[495,498],[499,502],[503,509],[510,512],[513,519],[520,523],[524,530],[531,532],[532,541],[542,546],[546,547],[547,548],[549,554],[555,557],[558,561],[562,569],[570,577],[578,583],[584,586],[587,594],[595,597],[598,601],[602,607],[608,611],[612,615],[616,621],[622,624],[625,634],[635,639],[640,644],[645,649],[649,650],[650,654],[654,655],[656,661],[662,664],[665,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,686],[687,695],[696,698],[699,704],[705,709],[710,713],[714,719],[720,726],[727,745],[746,750],[751,756],[757,761],[762,772],[773,777],[778,786],[787,792],[793,795],[796,803],[803,804],[805,806],[807,813],[814,816],[817,822],[823,830],[831,846],[847,852],[853,857],[858,871],[872,876],[877,882],[883,893],[894,902],[903,905],[906,911],[912,920],[921,927],[927,928]],"answers":["least prejudiced","least prejudiced","least prejudiced toward Jews"],"uuid":"56f8c0cd9b226e1400dd0f36-high-conf-turk0"},"1906":{"context":"There are a set of beautiful inlaid doors, dated 1580 from Antwerp City Hall, attributed to Hans Vredeman de Vries.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.

Radical Islamist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and groups such as the Taliban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those Muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent\/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.

The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly.

They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.","question":"What do you use to let idea strings switch direction?","spans":[[0,7],[8,14],[15,18],[19,21],[22,29],[30,35],[36,41],[42,49],[50,54],[55,58],[59,67],[67,68],[69,81],[81,82],[83,94],[94,95],[96,99],[100,113],[113,114],[115,119],[120,123],[124,126],[127,135],[136,140],[141,146],[147,154],[154,155],[156,161],[162,167],[168,173],[174,181],[182,184],[185,191],[192,200],[201,210],[210,211],[212,217],[218,225],[226,234],[235,242],[243,249],[250,265],[266,268],[269,275],[275,276],[276,284],[285,290],[291,293],[294,298],[299,301],[302,305],[306,313],[314,317],[318,327],[328,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,346],[346,347],[348,351],[352,357],[358,366],[367,372],[373,376],[377,383],[384,386],[387,390],[391,396],[397,403],[404,406],[407,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,429],[430,438],[439,444],[445,448],[449,455],[456,458],[459,462],[463,471],[472,481],[482,484],[485,488],[489,495],[496,502],[502,503],[504,506],[507,517],[518,521],[522,526],[527,533],[534,542],[543,548],[549,551],[552,555],[556,560],[561,567],[568,575],[576,579],[580,583],[584,586],[587,588],[589,592],[592,593],[593,595],[596,600],[601,605],[606,613],[614,621],[621,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,645],[646,650],[651,654],[655,657],[658,668],[668,669],[670,673],[674,679],[680,686],[687,691],[692,696],[697,699],[700,701],[702,706],[706,707],[708,715],[716,722],[723,725],[726,729],[730,737],[738,743],[744,746],[747,750],[751,757],[758,762],[763,765],[766,769],[770,774],[774,775],[776,783],[783,784],[785,789],[790,796],[797,801],[802,810],[811,816],[817,820],[821,823],[824,832],[833,835],[836,841],[841,842],[843,848],[849,851],[852,853],[854,867],[868,876],[877,879],[880,883],[884,890],[891,893],[894,900],[901,905],[906,910],[911,913],[914,923],[924,926],[927,932],[933,935],[936,940],[941,944],[945,949],[949,950],[951,956],[957,963],[964,971],[972,978],[979,989],[990,992],[993,996],[997,1009],[1010,1012],[1013,1023],[1024,1030],[1031,1036],[1037,1040],[1041,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1062],[1063,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1074],[1075,1077],[1078,1084],[1085,1088],[1089,1100],[1101,1104],[1105,1112],[1112,1113]],"answers":["ideal pulleys","ideal pulleys","ideal pulleys","ideal pulleys"],"uuid":"57379ed81c456719005744d6"},"1292":{"context":"The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a \"lifeboat\" in the event of a failure of the command ship.

It has been described that there were three different Militant movements.","question":"What have the two different Islamist movements been described as oscillating between?","spans":[[0,8],[8,9],[10,14],[15,20],[21,23],[24,33],[34,39],[40,41],[41,47],[47,48],[49,54],[55,61],[62,67],[68,74],[74,75],[75,76],[77,79],[80,82],[83,90],[91,98],[99,107],[108,113],[114,127],[128,130],[131,136],[137,149],[149,150],[151,161],[161,162],[163,166],[167,170],[171,178],[179,180],[180,182],[183,192],[193,200],[201,207],[208,210],[211,214],[215,222],[223,225],[226,230],[230,231],[231,232],[233,241],[242,248],[249,252],[253,263],[264,266],[267,277],[278,281],[282,289],[290,292],[293,303],[304,308],[309,312],[313,320],[320,321],[322,325],[326,335],[336,344],[345,354],[355,359],[360,364],[365,374],[375,377],[378,379],[379,390],[391,398],[399,402],[403,408],[408,409],[409,410],[411,413],[414,417],[418,421],[422,424],[425,426],[427,435],[436,438],[439,451],[452,454],[455,462],[463,470],[471,476],[477,482],[483,489],[490,492],[493,503],[504,506],[507,515],[515,516],[517,519],[520,523],[524,529],[530,531],[531,540],[540,541],[542,546],[547,556],[557,561],[562,564],[565,573],[574,581],[582,591],[592,593],[593,597],[598,601],[602,608],[609,611],[611,612],[612,613],[614,617],[618,627],[628,632],[633,634],[634,642],[643,650],[651,654],[655,661],[662,666],[667,671],[672,676],[677,680],[681,686],[687,692],[693,696],[697,703],[704,710],[711,717],[718,730],[730,731],[731,732],[733,743],[744,745],[745,753],[754,757],[758,762],[763,770],[770,771],[772,781],[782,784],[785,788],[789,799],[800,801],[801,806],[807,813],[813,814],[814,815],[816,818],[819,822],[823,827],[828,837],[838,842],[843,848],[849,853],[854,859],[860,869],[870,878],[879,888],[888,889]],"answers":["poles","two poles","poles"],"uuid":"572ff626947a6a140053ce91-high-conf-turk3"},"572":{"context":"In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by \"Queen Bees.\" He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.","question":"Who did Tesla think would run the world of the future?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,14],[15,24],[25,27],[28,31],[32,36],[37,39],[40,43],[44,50],[51,63],[64,66],[67,72],[73,76],[77,80],[81,89],[90,92],[93,98],[99,105],[106,112],[113,121],[121,122],[123,126],[127,136],[137,141],[142,150],[150,152],[153,159],[160,165],[166,168],[169,172],[173,175],[176,177],[177,182],[183,187],[187,188],[188,189],[190,192],[193,201],[202,206],[207,212],[213,218],[219,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,242],[243,245],[246,249],[250,256],[256,257]],"answers":["women","women","women"],"uuid":"56e1239acd28a01900c67641"},"3503":{"context":"British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759, when they finally captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec (in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders), and victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south.

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed \u00d6gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. The misconception is that philosophers in antiquity used to study complex machines.","question":"What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?","spans":[[0,12],[13,15],[16,25],[26,30],[31,34],[35,42],[43,45],[46,51],[52,54],[55,58],[59,64],[65,67],[68,78],[79,82],[83,89],[90,97],[98,101],[102,108],[109,117],[117,118],[119,122],[123,131],[132,136],[137,139],[140,149],[150,153],[154,164],[165,173],[174,185],[186,192],[193,195],[196,209],[210,215],[215,216],[217,219],[220,224],[225,229],[230,233],[234,237],[238,240],[241,243],[244,254],[255,268],[269,271],[272,275],[276,285],[286,289],[289,290],[290,297],[298,303],[304,306],[307,315],[315,316],[317,320],[321,322],[323,335],[336,346],[347,351],[352,354],[355,358],[359,365],[366,368],[369,376],[377,383],[383,384],[385,386],[387,398],[399,404],[405,408],[409,412],[413,419],[420,424],[425,426],[427,432],[433,435],[436,444],[445,447],[448,456],[457,463],[463,464],[465,469],[470,472],[473,474],[475,483],[484,492],[492,493],[494,498],[499,501],[502,505],[506,514],[515,532],[533,538],[539,545],[546,549],[550,555],[556,560],[561,571],[572,581],[582,584],[585,592],[593,600],[601,604],[605,608],[609,614],[615,621],[621,622],[623,627],[628,631],[632,644],[645,652],[652,653],[654,657],[658,663],[664,670],[671,681],[682,686],[687,689],[690,696],[697,701],[702,706],[707,710],[711,719],[719,720],[720,722],[723,726],[727,733],[734,739],[740,747],[748,753],[753,754],[755,757],[758,761],[762,767],[768,772],[773,780],[780,781],[782,790],[791,800],[801,802],[803,809],[810,812],[813,823],[824,828],[829,838],[839,848],[849,852],[853,859],[860,862],[863,869],[870,872],[873,880],[881,885],[886,896],[897,904],[905,909],[910,913],[914,919],[920,922],[923,928],[928,929],[930,933],[934,938],[939,947],[948,955],[956,960],[961,964],[965,971],[972,980],[981,983],[984,995],[996,999],[1000,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1026],[1027,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1060],[1061,1065],[1066,1068],[1069,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1091],[1091,1092]],"answers":["force","force","the concept of force","the concept of force","force","force"],"uuid":"573735e8c3c5551400e51e71-high-conf-turk1"},"2036":{"context":"Daytime programming is also provided from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. weekdays (with a one-hour break at 12:00 p.m. Eastern\/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, other locally produced programming such as talk shows, or syndicated programs) featuring the talk\/lifestyle shows The View and The Chew and the soap opera General Hospital.

Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.

In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.","question":"What Doctor was first referred to as \"his secret\"?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815]],"answers":["the War Doctor","an unknown incarnation of himself","the War Doctor"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c66"},"1815":{"context":"Train operator Virgin Trains East Coast provides a half-hourly frequency of trains to London King's Cross, with a journey time of about three hours, these services call at Durham, Darlington, York, Doncaster, Newark North Gate and Peterborough and north to Scotland with all trains calling at Edinburgh and a small number of trains extended to Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness.

Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single, internal market in the Single European Act 1986, to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.

Known as the \"Great Fire of 1901\", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902. The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.

Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had \u2018even the slightest sense of responsibility\u2019. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a \u20ac60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive. Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\"","question":"When did the Wahhabi seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744]],"answers":["November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2c1"},"1205":{"context":"Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides.

He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork.

At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester. In 1850, Tadakatsu enrolled in an engineering school.","question":"What year did Tesla enroll at an engineering school?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,14],[15,23],[24,26],[27,35],[36,47],[48,50],[51,55],[55,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,68],[69,70],[71,79],[80,88],[89,100],[100,101],[102,108],[109,112],[113,118],[119,123],[123,124],[125,130],[131,136],[137,143],[144,145],[146,153],[153,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,173],[174,180],[181,189],[189,190],[191,197],[198,202],[203,208],[209,210],[210,216],[217,222],[223,225],[226,230],[231,239],[239,240],[240,241],[242,249],[250,251],[252,259],[260,267],[268,272],[272,273],[274,277],[278,282],[283,291],[292,293],[294,300],[301,303],[304,316],[317,321],[322,325],[326,330],[331,333],[334,337],[338,347],[348,355],[356,358],[359,362],[363,369],[369,370],[371,376],[377,383],[383,384],[385,386],[386,390],[391,394],[395,397],[398,399],[400,404],[405,407],[408,413],[414,418],[418,419],[419,420],[421,426],[427,434],[435,439],[440,442],[443,449],[450,454],[455,456],[457,461],[462,464],[465,467],[468,472],[472,473],[474,476],[477,484],[485,487],[488,496],[497,505],[505,506],[507,509],[510,513],[514,515],[515,524],[525,529],[530,531],[531,534],[534,535],[536,542],[543,547],[548,553],[554,556],[557,558],[558,563],[563,564],[565,569],[570,573],[574,580],[580,581],[581,582],[583,588],[589,592],[593,599],[599,601],[602,607],[608,610],[611,615],[615,616],[617,622],[623,628],[629,630],[631,638],[639,641],[642,649],[650,654],[655,658],[659,669],[670,672],[673,676],[677,683],[683,684],[685,692],[693,697],[698,704],[705,707],[708,712],[713,720],[721,725],[726,729],[730,736],[736,737],[738,743],[744,749],[750,752],[753,759],[760,767],[768,776],[776,777],[778,784],[785,788],[789,795],[796,800],[800,801],[802,807],[808,812],[813,817],[818,826],[827,831],[832,841],[842,849],[850,854],[855,858],[859,865],[866,872],[872,873],[874,878],[879,884],[885,894],[895,899],[900,911],[912,916],[916,919],[920,929],[929,930],[931,933],[934,937],[938,941],[942,944],[945,948],[949,955],[956,960],[960,961],[962,967],[968,972],[973,976],[977,988],[989,992],[993,999],[1000,1008],[1009,1011],[1012,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1028],[1029,1032],[1033,1038],[1039,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1058],[1059,1063],[1064,1067],[1068,1077],[1078,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1093],[1094,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1106],[1107,1115],[1116,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1132],[1133,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1153],[1154,1157],[1158,1165],[1166,1168],[1169,1172],[1173,1179],[1179,1180],[1181,1186],[1187,1191],[1192,1196],[1197,1199],[1200,1201],[1201,1210],[1211,1212],[1212,1215],[1215,1216],[1217,1224],[1225,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1239],[1239,1240],[1240,1241],[1242,1245],[1246,1251],[1252,1254],[1255,1258],[1259,1264],[1265,1267],[1268,1272],[1273,1282],[1283,1285],[1286,1289],[1290,1292],[1292,1293],[1294,1298],[1299,1303],[1304,1308],[1309,1313],[1313,1314],[1315,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1335],[1336,1339],[1340,1345],[1346,1349],[1350,1352],[1353,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1371],[1371,1372],[1373,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1387,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1397],[1398,1407],[1408,1412],[1413,1416],[1417,1427],[1428,1431],[1432,1435],[1436,1439],[1440,1447],[1448,1454],[1455,1458],[1459,1462],[1463,1467],[1468,1476],[1476,1477],[1478,1480],[1481,1485],[1485,1486],[1487,1496],[1497,1505],[1506,1508],[1509,1511],[1512,1523],[1524,1530],[1530,1531]],"answers":["1875","1875","1875"],"uuid":"56dfa3c338dc421700152154-high-conf-turk3"},"2291":{"context":"Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time\u2014and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action.

The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.

Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.","question":"What company took over Edison Machine Works?","spans":[[0,5],[5,7],[8,21],[22,24],[25,28],[29,38],[39,44],[45,48],[49,61],[61,63],[64,74],[75,84],[85,87],[88,91],[92,98],[98,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,123],[124,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,139],[139,141],[141,142],[143,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,157],[157,158],[158,164],[165,166],[166,169],[170,172],[173,181],[181,182],[182,183],[184,186],[187,197],[198,210],[211,217],[218,223],[224,229],[230,237],[238,244],[245,251],[252,255],[256,262],[263,275],[276,280],[281,284],[285,289],[290,299],[300,305],[306,318],[318,320],[321,326],[327,329],[330,336],[337,339],[340,344],[345,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,370],[371,373],[374,377],[377,378],[378,381],[382,389],[390,392],[393,397],[397,398],[399,403],[404,411],[412,415],[416,418],[419,420],[421,432],[433,440],[441,446],[447,455],[456,463],[464,468],[469,475],[476,483],[484,487],[488,491],[492,499],[500,503],[504,506],[507,510],[511,514],[515,527],[528,533],[534,537],[538,550],[551,556],[557,560],[561,564],[565,573],[574,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,592],[593,596],[597,603],[604,606],[607,611],[612,614],[615,627],[628,633],[634,636],[637,638],[639,647],[648,657],[658,664],[665,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,682],[683,689],[690,696],[696,697],[698,701],[702,713],[714,716],[717,718],[719,727],[728,730],[731,736],[737,741],[742,754],[755,756],[757,760],[761,767],[768,770],[771,779],[780,781],[782,792],[793,803],[804,806],[807,813],[813,814],[815,818],[819,822],[823,832],[833,839],[840,842],[843,849],[850,852],[853,860],[861,864],[865,871],[872,875],[876,885],[886,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,904],[905,910],[911,922],[923,925],[926,931],[931,933],[934,939],[940,943],[944,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,956],[957,961],[962,965],[966,967],[968,973],[973,974],[975,978],[979,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1009],[1010,1017],[1018,1023],[1024,1032],[1033,1035],[1036,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1158],[1159,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1188],[1189,1192],[1193,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1221],[1222,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1236],[1237,1242],[1242,1243]],"answers":["General Electric","General Electric","General Electric"],"uuid":"56e05a78231d4119001ac065"},"1704":{"context":"In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million.

Even a good form of government is \u201cliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\u201d Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.","question":"Who was the Denver head coach for Super Bowl 50?","spans":[[0,9],[10,15],[16,20],[21,23],[24,27],[28,38],[39,44],[45,47],[48,51],[52,60],[61,67],[67,69],[70,78],[78,79],[80,83],[84,90],[91,98],[99,108],[109,117],[118,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,145],[146,147],[148,154],[155,162],[163,167],[168,172],[173,178],[179,183],[184,187],[188,189],[189,192],[193,196],[197,200],[201,205],[206,216],[217,230],[231,233],[234,237],[238,242],[243,248],[249,251],[252,259],[260,264],[265,270],[270,271],[271,272],[273,276],[277,280],[281,287],[288,290],[291,295],[296,302],[303,305],[306,309],[310,313],[314,318],[319,324],[324,325],[326,331],[332,338],[338,339],[340,343],[344,351],[352,359],[360,362],[363,370],[371,372],[373,376],[376,377],[377,385],[386,393],[394,398],[399,403],[404,412],[413,415],[416,421],[422,424],[425,429],[430,441],[442,448],[449,456],[456,458],[459,466],[467,474],[475,481],[481,482],[483,486],[487,496],[497,501],[502,510],[511,518],[519,522],[523,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,548],[549,553],[553,554],[555,557],[558,562],[563,565],[566,573],[574,580],[581,584],[585,590],[591,602],[603,609],[610,615],[616,619],[620,626],[627,631],[632,636],[637,640],[641,653],[654,659],[660,662],[663,667],[667,668],[669,672],[673,675],[676,677],[678,685],[686,695],[696,702],[703,705],[706,709],[710,714],[715,719],[720,722],[723,726],[727,735],[736,741],[742,745],[746,752],[752,753],[754,757],[758,761],[762,768],[769,773],[774,778],[779,786],[787,790],[791,798],[799,802],[802,803],[804,806],[807,809],[810,816],[817,819],[820,822],[823,826],[827,831],[832,835],[835,836],[836,842],[842,843],[844,852],[853,856],[857,861],[862,865],[866,867],[868,871],[872,877],[877,878],[879,886],[887,890],[891,894],[895,898],[899,901],[902,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,924],[925,927],[927,928],[929,936],[937,945],[946,947],[948,955],[956,960],[961,963],[964,967],[968,975],[976,985],[986,988],[989,992],[993,997],[998,1002],[1002,1003],[1004,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1018],[1018,1020],[1021,1024],[1024,1025],[1025,1029],[1030,1036],[1037,1040],[1041,1047],[1048,1055],[1056,1061],[1062,1064],[1065,1069],[1070,1074],[1074,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1083],[1084,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1134],[1135,1137],[1138,1144],[1145,1156],[1157,1162],[1163,1171],[1171,1172],[1173,1176],[1177,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1189],[1190,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1213],[1214,1217],[1218,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1234],[1235,1242],[1243,1249],[1249,1250],[1251,1259],[1260,1263],[1264,1271],[1271,1272],[1273,1280],[1280,1281],[1282,1289],[1290,1292],[1293,1300],[1300,1302],[1303,1309],[1310,1316],[1317,1320],[1321,1325],[1326,1328],[1329,1336],[1337,1343],[1344,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1357],[1358,1361],[1362,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1394],[1395,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1413],[1414,1422],[1422,1423],[1424,1433],[1434,1436],[1437,1444],[1445,1447],[1447,1448],[1448,1456],[1457,1460],[1461,1469],[1470,1481],[1482,1490],[1491,1494],[1495,1498],[1499,1507],[1508,1510],[1511,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1532],[1533,1536],[1537,1542],[1543,1546],[1547,1551],[1552,1559],[1560,1563],[1564,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1578],[1579,1582],[1583,1589],[1590,1593],[1594,1601],[1602,1605],[1606,1610],[1610,1611],[1612,1617],[1618,1627],[1628,1639],[1640,1644],[1645,1653],[1653,1654],[1655,1658],[1659,1666],[1666,1667],[1668,1675],[1676,1682],[1683,1689],[1690,1693],[1694,1696],[1697,1702],[1703,1708],[1709,1716],[1716,1717],[1718,1725],[1726,1731],[1732,1739],[1740,1743],[1744,1749],[1749,1750],[1751,1754],[1755,1759],[1760,1763],[1764,1772],[1773,1778],[1779,1786],[1786,1787],[1788,1791],[1792,1796],[1797,1800],[1801,1810],[1811,1813],[1814,1817],[1818,1826],[1827,1837],[1837,1838],[1839,1845],[1846,1849],[1850,1859],[1860,1867],[1867,1868],[1869,1873],[1874,1877],[1878,1885],[1886,1894],[1895,1898],[1899,1903],[1904,1911],[1912,1915],[1916,1922],[1923,1927],[1928,1931],[1932,1939],[1939,1940],[1941,1944],[1945,1952],[1953,1961],[1962,1965],[1966,1973],[1974,1980],[1981,1985],[1986,1987],[1988,1992],[1993,1999],[2000,2003],[2004,2010],[2011,2015],[2015,2016],[2016,2021],[2022,2031],[2032,2042],[2043,2046],[2047,2050],[2051,2059],[2059,2060]],"answers":["Gary Kubiak","Gary Kubiak","Kubiak"],"uuid":"56d99b7bdc89441400fdb5ca"},"1534":{"context":"Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space. The method that was learned was used to clear the Amazon forests for crop cultivation.","question":"What method was used to clear forest for crop cultivation in the amazon forest?","spans":[[0,13],[14,16],[17,20],[21,31],[32,34],[35,43],[44,49],[50,52],[53,56],[56,57],[57,65],[66,71],[71,72],[73,76],[77,81],[82,89],[90,92],[93,106],[107,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,124],[125,130],[131,141],[142,145],[146,157],[158,160],[161,164],[165,169],[169,170],[171,176],[177,179],[180,183],[184,189],[190,195],[195,196],[197,203],[204,206],[207,210],[211,217],[217,219],[220,228],[229,232],[233,239],[240,250],[250,251],[252,255],[256,259],[260,266],[267,275],[276,285],[286,292],[292,293],[294,299],[300,311],[312,318],[319,322],[323,328],[329,333],[334,339],[340,342],[343,347],[348,359],[360,363],[364,367],[368,373],[374,377],[378,382],[383,389],[389,390],[391,398],[398,399],[400,403],[404,413],[414,418],[419,425],[426,428],[429,435],[436,441],[442,448],[449,452],[453,456],[457,462],[463,470],[471,473],[474,477],[478,482],[483,485],[486,490],[491,500],[501,504],[505,509],[510,518],[518,519],[520,523],[524,529],[530,532],[533,536],[537,543],[544,547],[548,558],[559,562],[563,567],[568,569],[570,575],[576,582],[583,585],[586,590],[590,591],[592,594],[595,602],[603,606],[607,617],[618,624],[625,627],[628,631],[632,637],[638,641],[642,650],[651,655],[656,660],[660,661],[662,667],[668,675],[676,685],[686,689],[690,692],[693,706],[707,710],[711,717],[718,727],[728,741],[742,748],[748,749],[750,763],[764,766],[767,779],[779,780],[781,784],[785,790],[791,798],[799,801],[802,808],[809,812],[813,820],[821,823],[824,827],[828,833],[834,837],[838,842],[843,848],[849,854],[854,855],[856,859],[860,866],[867,871],[872,875],[876,883],[884,887],[888,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,905],[906,912],[913,920],[921,924],[925,929],[930,941],[941,942]],"answers":["slash and burn method","slash and burn","slash and burn"],"uuid":"5729fd56af94a219006aa731-high-conf-turk2"},"2691":{"context":"During the ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million.[citation needed] Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months.

The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.

He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment.

Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.","question":"What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing, after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,20],[21,27],[28,30],[31,34],[35,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,61],[62,64],[65,67],[68,71],[71,72],[72,78],[79,82],[83,85],[86,89],[90,96],[97,99],[100,106],[107,108],[109,110],[110,116],[116,117],[118,121],[122,125],[126,131],[132,140],[141,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,161],[162,163],[163,164],[165,173],[174,175],[176,181],[182,183],[184,187],[188,190],[191,199],[200,201],[201,202],[203,207],[207,208],[209,212],[213,223],[224,226],[227,230],[231,238],[239,245],[245,247],[248,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,270],[271,272],[273,278],[278,279],[279,284],[285,292],[293,296],[297,309],[310,312],[313,318],[319,322],[323,330],[331,337],[338,344],[345,347],[348,351],[352,354],[355,359],[360,363],[364,374],[375,377],[378,384],[385,389],[390,393],[394,399],[400,405],[405,406],[406,413],[414,421],[422,427],[427,428],[429,433],[434,437],[438,446],[447,449],[450,455],[456,457],[457,458],[459,463],[463,464],[465,467],[468,474],[475,476],[477,478],[478,484],[484,485],[486,491],[492,499],[500,501],[502,505],[506,509],[510,511],[512,514],[515,519],[520,527],[528,530],[531,538],[538,539],[540,543],[544,550],[551,553],[554,558],[559,566],[567,570],[571,573],[574,581],[582,587],[587,588],[588,593],[594,603],[603,604],[605,613],[614,621],[622,624],[625,626],[627,636],[637,643],[643,644],[644,650],[651,656],[656,657],[658,663],[664,667],[668,675],[676,682],[683,689],[690,692],[693,700],[701,708],[709,713],[713,714],[714,719],[720,727],[727,728],[729,732],[733,739],[740,741],[742,753],[754,758],[759,770],[770,771],[772,773],[774,781],[782,788],[789,791],[792,795],[795,796],[796,802],[803,809],[810,820],[820,821],[822,827],[828,835],[836,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,853],[854,860],[861,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878],[879,882],[883,884],[884,885],[885,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[906,917],[917,918],[919,922],[923,926],[927,936],[937,944],[945,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,968],[968,969],[970,973],[974,980],[981,983],[984,987],[988,993],[994,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1022],[1022,1023],[1024,1034],[1035,1037],[1038,1042],[1043,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1063],[1063,1064],[1064,1069],[1070,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1129],[1130,1136],[1137,1143],[1144,1146],[1147,1158],[1159,1165],[1166,1169],[1170,1176],[1177,1184],[1185,1187],[1188,1194],[1195,1196],[1196,1197],[1198,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1215],[1216,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1239],[1240,1243],[1244,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1274],[1275,1280],[1281,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1294],[1295,1296],[1297,1305],[1305,1306],[1307,1311],[1312,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1331],[1332,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1346],[1347,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1362],[1363,1364],[1365,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1384],[1384,1385]],"answers":["third unmanned test","Apollo 6","third unmanned test","cancelling a third unmanned test","third unmanned test."],"uuid":"5725e08389a1e219009ac013"},"3229":{"context":"As in the House of Commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP.

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history. Yale Arena became the final abstract-reinforced stadium in the country in 1878.","question":"In what year did Harvard Stadium become the first ever concrete reinforced stadium in the country?","spans":[[0,7],[7,9],[10,18],[19,26],[27,31],[32,36],[37,39],[40,47],[48,50],[51,56],[57,62],[63,65],[66,71],[72,76],[77,81],[81,82],[83,89],[90,92],[93,94],[95,101],[102,106],[107,111],[112,114],[115,118],[119,125],[126,134],[135,142],[142,143],[144,149],[150,155],[156,160],[161,163],[164,168],[169,172],[173,175],[176,183],[184,190],[191,197],[198,199],[199,202],[203,207],[207,208],[208,209],[210,215],[216,223],[223,225],[226,234],[235,239],[240,242],[243,245],[246,252],[253,256],[257,259],[260,263],[264,271],[271,273],[274,278],[279,281],[282,284],[285,290],[291,294],[295,296],[297,304],[305,308],[309,315],[316,324],[324,326],[327,332],[333,337],[338,339],[339,341],[342,345],[346,349],[350,354],[355,359],[360,362],[363,367],[367,368],[368,369],[370,374],[375,377],[378,381],[382,386],[387,391],[392,402],[403,406],[407,410],[411,414],[415,419],[420,422],[423,429],[429,430],[431,433],[434,438],[438,439],[440,447],[448,455],[456,466],[467,468],[469,472],[473,476],[477,481],[482,490],[491,495],[496,499],[500,505],[505,506],[506,510],[511,520],[521,531],[532,540],[541,548],[549,551],[552,555],[556,560],[561,563],[564,567],[568,575],[575,576],[577,580],[581,588],[588,590],[591,600],[601,609],[610,616],[617,618],[619,623],[624,626],[627,630],[631,640],[641,643],[644,647],[648,655],[656,660],[660,661],[662,669],[670,672],[673,679],[680,683],[684,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,709],[710,713],[714,721],[722,730],[731,733],[734,737],[738,743],[743,744],[745,751],[752,756],[757,758],[758,764],[765,772],[773,775],[776,779],[780,784],[785,793],[794,798],[798,799],[799,800],[801,810],[811,819],[820,823],[824,829],[830,832],[833,837],[838,840],[841,844],[845,849],[849,850],[851,854],[855,858],[859,866],[867,870],[871,874],[875,881],[882,884],[885,896],[897,898],[899,904],[905,912],[913,920],[920,921],[922,924],[924,925],[926,931],[932,937],[938,941],[942,944],[945,947],[948,953],[953,954],[955,959],[960,965],[966,973],[974,981],[982,995],[996,999],[1000,1005],[1006,1009],[1010,1013],[1014,1018],[1019,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1032],[1033,1041],[1042,1052],[1053,1056],[1057,1064],[1065,1069],[1069,1070],[1071,1078],[1079,1082],[1083,1087],[1088,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1118],[1119,1124],[1124,1126],[1127,1134],[1134,1135],[1136,1140],[1141,1146],[1147,1153],[1154,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1172],[1172,1173],[1173,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1206],[1207,1209],[1210,1214],[1214,1215]],"answers":["1903","1903","1903"],"uuid":"5727db85ff5b5019007d96fd-high-conf-turk4"},"2813":{"context":"In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Sh\u014ds\u014din, in Japan.","question":"Which arts were often practiced together by the same artists?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,15],[16,19],[20,24],[24,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,39],[39,40],[41,48],[49,58],[59,71],[72,74],[75,78],[79,83],[84,92],[93,95],[96,105],[106,108],[109,114],[115,126],[126,127],[128,137],[138,141],[142,147],[148,150],[151,159],[159,160],[161,172],[172,173],[174,185],[185,186],[187,193],[193,194],[195,198],[199,206],[206,207],[208,212],[213,217],[218,223],[224,231],[232,235],[236,243],[244,249],[250,256],[257,262],[262,263],[264,267],[268,270],[271,274],[275,281],[282,290],[291,293],[294,302],[302,303],[304,310],[310,311],[312,315],[316,327],[328,330],[331,335],[336,340],[341,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,371],[372,377],[378,387],[388,396],[397,401],[402,405],[406,410],[411,422],[422,423],[424,430],[431,438],[439,443],[444,449],[450,453],[454,457],[458,462],[463,465],[466,471],[472,484],[485,489],[490,496],[496,497],[498,503],[504,506],[507,512],[513,515],[516,519],[520,527],[528,539],[540,542],[543,552],[553,561],[562,564],[565,569],[570,572],[573,576],[577,586],[587,594],[595,603],[604,606],[607,610],[611,615],[616,618],[619,627],[627,628],[629,635],[635,636],[637,640],[641,652],[652,653],[654,657],[658,662],[663,670],[671,674],[675,678],[679,683],[684,691],[692,695],[696,702],[703,711],[711,712],[713,715],[716,719],[720,724],[725,727],[728,735],[736,744],[745,751],[752,755],[756,760],[761,768],[769,774],[775,779],[780,784],[785,791],[792,800],[800,801],[802,804],[805,808],[809,813],[814,816],[817,828],[829,833],[834,836],[837,840],[841,846],[847,860],[861,865],[866,870],[871,874],[875,879],[880,887],[888,891],[891,892],[893,895],[896,900],[901,907],[907,908],[909,912],[913,917],[918,929],[930,933],[934,937],[938,940],[940,941],[942,947],[948,951],[952,956],[957,962],[963,968],[969,975],[976,981],[982,984],[985,989],[990,992],[993,996],[997,1003],[1004,1008],[1009,1014],[1014,1015],[1016,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1027],[1028,1033],[1034,1038],[1039,1043],[1044,1052],[1053,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1065],[1066,1078],[1079,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1093],[1094,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1110],[1110,1111],[1112,1115],[1116,1119],[1120,1125],[1126,1129],[1130,1136],[1136,1137],[1138,1142],[1143,1149],[1150,1159],[1160,1162],[1163,1166],[1167,1174],[1175,1183],[1184,1190],[1191,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1214],[1215,1217],[1218,1221],[1222,1227],[1228,1232],[1233,1235],[1236,1238],[1238,1239],[1240,1243],[1244,1246],[1247,1250],[1251,1254],[1255,1262],[1263,1265],[1266,1269],[1270,1273],[1274,1276],[1277,1280],[1281,1285],[1286,1293],[1294,1298],[1299,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1330],[1331,1335],[1336,1345],[1346,1349],[1350,1352],[1353,1356],[1357,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1370],[1370,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1378],[1379,1382],[1383,1392],[1393,1401],[1402,1414],[1415,1421],[1422,1425],[1426,1430],[1431,1434],[1435,1438],[1439,1442],[1443,1456],[1457,1459],[1460,1466],[1466,1467],[1468,1476],[1476,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1493],[1494,1498],[1499,1500],[1501,1508],[1509,1514],[1515,1517],[1518,1521],[1522,1526],[1527,1531],[1532,1537],[1538,1540],[1541,1545],[1546,1548],[1549,1553],[1554,1558],[1559,1565],[1566,1571],[1572,1574],[1575,1584],[1585,1592],[1593,1596],[1596,1597],[1598,1605],[1606,1615],[1616,1622],[1623,1625],[1626,1630],[1631,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1643],[1644,1654],[1655,1668],[1669,1671],[1672,1675],[1676,1680],[1681,1688],[1688,1689],[1690,1700],[1701,1708],[1709,1713],[1714,1718],[1719,1722],[1723,1725],[1726,1730],[1731,1733],[1734,1740],[1741,1744],[1745,1748],[1749,1753],[1754,1761],[1762,1766],[1766,1767],[1768,1775],[1776,1785],[1786,1799],[1800,1809],[1810,1814],[1815,1822],[1823,1827],[1828,1831],[1832,1839],[1840,1842],[1843,1847],[1848,1850],[1851,1855],[1856,1858],[1859,1861],[1862,1865],[1866,1874],[1875,1877],[1878,1883],[1883,1884],[1885,1895],[1896,1898],[1899,1904],[1905,1909],[1910,1913],[1914,1918],[1919,1926],[1927,1930],[1931,1935],[1936,1943],[1943,1944],[1945,1950],[1951,1955],[1956,1961],[1962,1966],[1967,1973],[1974,1983],[1984,1986],[1987,1993],[1994,1998],[1999,2001],[2002,2005],[2006,2013],[2013,2014],[2015,2017],[2018,2023],[2023,2024]],"answers":["painting, poetry, and calligraphy","painting, poetry, and calligraphy","painting, poetry, and calligraphy"],"uuid":"57287f6a3acd2414000dfa52"},"1712":{"context":"Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model. Seismologists use the types of waves to image the outside of the Mars.","question":"What types of waves do seismologists use to image the interior of the Earth?","spans":[[0,13],[14,17],[18,21],[22,25],[26,33],[34,39],[40,42],[43,50],[51,56],[57,59],[60,67],[68,70],[71,76],[77,80],[81,89],[90,92],[93,96],[97,102],[102,103],[104,109],[110,118],[119,121],[122,126],[127,132],[133,139],[140,143],[144,153],[154,156],[157,158],[159,165],[166,171],[172,176],[177,178],[178,183],[184,189],[190,195],[196,200],[201,204],[205,209],[210,212],[213,222],[222,223],[224,227],[228,229],[230,235],[236,241],[242,247],[248,252],[252,253],[254,259],[260,268],[269,272],[273,275],[276,279],[280,291],[292,294],[295,296],[297,304],[305,310],[311,313],[314,317],[318,323],[323,324],[325,329],[330,331],[332,337],[338,341],[342,353],[354,356],[357,360],[360,361],[362,365],[366,372],[373,378],[379,380],[380,389],[390,396],[397,403],[404,406],[407,414],[415,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,441],[442,445],[446,456],[456,457],[457,458],[459,462],[463,466],[467,472],[473,477],[478,481],[482,487],[488,492],[493,498],[499,503],[503,504],[505,509],[510,518],[518,519],[520,533],[534,538],[539,543],[544,548],[549,551],[552,558],[559,567],[568,574],[575,577],[578,582],[583,589],[590,596],[597,600],[601,606],[607,609],[610,613],[614,618],[619,622],[623,624],[625,631],[632,638],[639,640],[641,645],[646,648],[649,650],[651,653],[654,658],[658,659],[660,665],[666,672],[673,677],[678,681],[682,684],[685,686],[687,691],[692,696],[697,705],[706,710],[711,713],[714,717],[718,726],[727,729],[730,733],[734,739],[739,740],[741,744],[745,749],[750,758],[759,762],[763,773],[774,781],[782,787],[788,792],[793,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,812],[813,818],[818,819],[820,833],[834,837],[838,841],[842,847],[848,850],[851,856],[857,859],[860,865],[866,869],[870,877],[878,880],[881,884],[885,889],[889,890]],"answers":["seismic waves","seismic","seismic","seismic"],"uuid":"57266193dd62a815002e832a-high-conf-turk0"},"2779":{"context":"Kublai's government faced financial difficulties after 1279. Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury. Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals. Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon. Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols. The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh (\u9673\u4eac, Ch\u00e9n J\u012bng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty which ruled Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (later King Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\". Annam, Burma, and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty.","question":"Where did the Tran dynasty rule?","spans":[[0,6],[6,8],[9,19],[20,25],[26,35],[36,48],[49,54],[55,59],[59,60],[61,65],[66,69],[70,82],[83,91],[92,95],[96,103],[104,107],[108,114],[115,123],[123,124],[125,132],[133,135],[136,141],[142,145],[146,153],[154,157],[158,166],[167,171],[172,179],[180,182],[183,193],[194,197],[198,207],[208,216],[216,217],[218,228],[229,237],[238,249],[250,258],[259,262],[263,272],[273,281],[281,282],[283,289],[289,291],[292,298],[299,307],[308,310],[311,316],[317,319],[320,324],[325,331],[332,339],[340,342],[343,345],[346,358],[359,366],[366,367],[368,374],[375,382],[383,386],[387,396],[397,404],[405,410],[410,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,423],[424,428],[428,429],[430,433],[434,437],[438,439],[440,447],[448,455],[456,463],[464,469],[469,470],[471,474],[475,486],[487,491],[492,500],[501,503],[504,511],[511,512],[513,515],[516,528],[529,536],[536,537],[538,541],[542,543],[544,552],[553,560],[561,571],[572,575],[576,579],[580,587],[588,595],[596,598],[599,602],[603,610],[610,611],[612,615],[616,620],[621,628],[629,634],[635,640],[641,646],[647,648],[648,651],[652,656],[656,657],[658,665],[666,669],[670,678],[679,682],[683,690],[691,693],[694,697],[698,704],[705,707],[708,712],[713,717],[718,719],[719,723],[723,724],[724,725],[726,729],[730,737],[738,744],[745,747],[748,754],[755,758],[759,762],[763,771],[772,776],[777,779],[780,783],[784,791],[792,796],[797,798],[798,802],[802,803],[804,808],[809,815],[816,820],[821,829],[830,835],[836,840],[841,845],[846,847],[847,849],[849,850],[851,855],[856,860],[860,861],[862,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,877],[878,883],[884,895],[896,907],[908,911],[912,916],[917,924],[925,930],[931,936],[937,944],[945,948],[949,953],[953,954],[955,958],[959,966],[967,974],[975,977],[978,981],[982,986],[987,992],[993,998],[999,1004],[1005,1012],[1013,1017],[1018,1020],[1021,1025],[1026,1027],[1028,1032],[1033,1040],[1041,1046],[1047,1050],[1051,1052],[1053,1060],[1061,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1077],[1077,1078],[1078,1086],[1087,1091],[1092,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1108],[1109,1113],[1114,1115],[1115,1120],[1121,1125],[1126,1130],[1131,1135],[1136,1139],[1139,1140],[1141,1143],[1144,1148],[1148,1149],[1150,1159],[1160,1164],[1165,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1182],[1183,1189],[1190,1194],[1195,1199],[1200,1207],[1208,1213],[1214,1218],[1219,1223],[1224,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1236],[1237,1244],[1245,1249],[1250,1252],[1253,1257],[1258,1265],[1266,1271],[1272,1279],[1280,1285],[1286,1289],[1290,1296],[1297,1305],[1306,1308],[1309,1312],[1313,1317],[1318,1321],[1322,1326],[1327,1333],[1334,1337],[1338,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1357,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1376],[1376,1377],[1378,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1394],[1395,1405],[1406,1410],[1411,1414],[1415,1421],[1422,1428],[1429,1431],[1432,1437],[1438,1440],[1441,1444],[1445,1448],[1449,1455],[1456,1462],[1463,1465],[1466,1473],[1474,1477],[1478,1486],[1487,1490],[1491,1497],[1498,1506],[1507,1510],[1511,1519],[1520,1522],[1523,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1532],[1532,1540],[1541,1548],[1548,1549],[1549,1550],[1551,1556],[1556,1557],[1558,1563],[1563,1564],[1565,1568],[1569,1575],[1576,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1602],[1603,1606],[1607,1618],[1619,1628],[1629,1638],[1639,1643],[1644,1647],[1648,1652],[1653,1660],[1660,1661]],"answers":["Annam (Dai Viet)","Annam","Annam"],"uuid":"57286dfa2ca10214002da334"},"937":{"context":"Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007\u201308 season.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point. Stark Industries took over the Calpine Device Well.","question":"What company took over Edison Machine Works?","spans":[[0,5],[5,7],[8,21],[22,24],[25,28],[29,38],[39,44],[45,48],[49,61],[61,63],[64,74],[75,84],[85,87],[88,91],[92,98],[98,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,123],[124,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,139],[139,141],[141,142],[143,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,157],[157,158],[158,164],[165,166],[166,169],[170,172],[173,181],[181,182],[182,183],[184,186],[187,197],[198,210],[211,217],[218,223],[224,229],[230,237],[238,244],[245,251],[252,255],[256,262],[263,275],[276,280],[281,284],[285,289],[290,299],[300,305],[306,318],[318,320],[321,326],[327,329],[330,336],[337,339],[340,344],[345,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,370],[371,373],[374,377],[377,378],[378,381],[382,389],[390,392],[393,397],[397,398],[399,403],[404,411],[412,415],[416,418],[419,420],[421,432],[433,440],[441,446],[447,455],[456,463],[464,468],[469,475],[476,483],[484,487],[488,491],[492,499],[500,503],[504,506],[507,510],[511,514],[515,527],[528,533],[534,537],[538,550],[551,556],[557,560],[561,564],[565,573],[574,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,592],[593,596],[597,603],[604,606],[607,611],[612,614],[615,627],[628,633],[634,636],[637,638],[639,647],[648,657],[658,664],[665,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,682],[683,689],[690,696],[696,697],[698,701],[702,713],[714,716],[717,718],[719,727],[728,730],[731,736],[737,741],[742,754],[755,756],[757,760],[761,767],[768,770],[771,779],[780,781],[782,792],[793,803],[804,806],[807,813],[813,814],[815,818],[819,822],[823,832],[833,839],[840,842],[843,849],[850,852],[853,860],[861,864],[865,871],[872,875],[876,885],[886,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,904],[905,910],[911,922],[923,925],[926,931],[931,933],[934,939],[940,943],[944,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,956],[957,961],[962,965],[966,967],[968,973],[973,974],[975,978],[979,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1009],[1010,1017],[1018,1023],[1024,1032],[1033,1035],[1036,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1158],[1159,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1188],[1189,1192],[1193,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1221],[1222,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1236],[1237,1242],[1242,1243],[1244,1249],[1250,1260],[1261,1265],[1266,1270],[1271,1274],[1275,1282],[1283,1289],[1290,1294],[1294,1295]],"answers":["General Electric","General Electric","General Electric"],"uuid":"56e05a78231d4119001ac065-high-conf-turk3"},"1679":{"context":"The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures.

Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.","question":"How many people may have lived in the Amazon region during AD 1500?","spans":[[0,3],[4,5],[6,10],[11,15],[15,16],[17,19],[20,23],[24,31],[32,36],[37,40],[41,47],[48,58],[59,62],[63,67],[68,72],[73,81],[82,91],[91,92],[93,95],[96,98],[99,102],[103,113],[114,116],[117,124],[125,126],[127,132],[133,143],[144,151],[152,163],[164,169],[170,173],[174,178],[179,183],[183,184],[185,197],[198,203],[204,211],[212,215],[216,217],[218,227],[228,237],[238,240],[241,245],[246,250],[250,251],[252,254],[255,264],[265,267],[268,271],[272,276],[277,285],[285,286],[287,290],[291,294],[295,302],[303,305],[306,307],[308,319],[320,328],[328,329],[330,333],[334,341],[342,346],[347,348],[349,359],[360,367],[368,370],[371,374],[375,386],[387,390],[391,397],[398,407],[408,409],[409,416],[417,419],[419,420],[421,423],[424,427],[428,435],[436,440],[441,444],[445,447],[448,457],[458,460],[461,464],[465,475],[476,483],[484,491],[491,492],[493,497],[498,509],[510,516],[517,519],[520,524],[525,526],[527,533],[534,544],[544,545],[546,553],[553,554],[555,561],[562,577],[578,586],[587,591],[592,601],[602,606],[607,610],[611,617],[618,621],[622,630],[631,638],[639,648],[648,649],[650,654],[655,656],[657,664],[665,671],[672,675],[676,680],[681,686],[687,689],[690,693],[694,700],[701,707],[708,710],[711,713],[714,718],[718,719],[720,727],[728,735],[736,741],[742,749],[750,761],[761,762],[763,767],[768,770],[771,775],[776,778],[779,785],[785,786],[787,790],[791,797],[798,806],[806,807],[808,810],[811,815],[816,819],[820,830],[831,834],[835,841],[842,844],[845,846],[847,854],[855,858],[859,861],[862,865],[866,871],[872,877],[878,880],[881,884],[885,889],[890,894],[895,902],[902,903]],"answers":["5 million","5 million","5 million"],"uuid":"5725c95f38643c19005accf7"},"2230":{"context":"The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is \"remembered\" by a signature antigen.

Chicago caught and shipped the fewest abalone and lobster from its waters in the 19th century.","question":"To where is most of the abalone and lobster caught in Victorian waters shipped?","spans":[[0,8],[9,11],[12,15],[16,22],[23,25],[26,31],[32,39],[40,42],[43,52],[52,53],[54,56],[57,59],[60,64],[65,67],[68,70],[70,71],[72,74],[75,84],[84,86],[87,88],[89,96],[97,102],[103,109],[110,113],[114,122],[123,129],[130,133],[133,134],[134,140],[141,143],[144,147],[148,154],[154,156],[157,161],[161,162],[163,169],[170,173],[174,181],[182,188],[188,189],[190,193],[194,199],[200,204],[205,208],[209,212],[213,220],[221,225],[226,232],[232,233],[234,238],[239,243],[244,248],[249,252],[253,260],[261,267],[268,271],[272,278],[279,290],[291,295],[296,300],[300,301],[302,304],[305,312],[312,313],[314,323],[324,334],[335,342],[343,348],[349,352],[353,364],[365,373],[374,382],[383,389],[390,396],[397,399],[400,407],[408,414],[415,417],[418,424],[425,427],[427,430],[431,438],[438,439],[440,451],[452,459],[460,462],[463,466],[467,475],[476,478],[479,482],[483,488],[488,489],[490,498],[499,501],[502,504],[504,506],[507,514],[514,515],[516,524],[525,527],[528,536],[537,541],[542,549],[550,555],[556,558],[558,562],[563,570],[570,571],[572,576],[577,584],[585,588],[589,593],[594,601],[602,604],[605,613],[614,616],[617,621],[621,622],[623,630],[631,637],[638,641],[642,649],[650,653],[654,660],[661,668],[669,672],[673,680],[681,685],[686,689],[690,696],[697,699],[700,703],[704,708],[709,716],[716,717]],"answers":["Asia","Asia","Asia"],"uuid":"570d4606b3d812140066d61d-high-conf-turk1"},"2008":{"context":"Also part of the library is the aforementioned Selznick library, the Cinerama Productions\/Palomar theatrical library and the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as America's Funniest Home Videos, General Hospital, and ABC News productions), although Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television (formerly known as Buena Vista Television) handles domestic television distribution, while Disney\u2013ABC International Television (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.","question":"What ABC division handles domestic television distribution?","spans":[[0,4],[5,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,24],[25,27],[28,31],[32,46],[47,55],[56,63],[63,64],[65,68],[69,77],[78,89],[89,90],[90,97],[98,108],[109,116],[117,120],[121,124],[125,131],[132,143],[144,151],[152,156],[157,160],[161,168],[169,177],[178,182],[183,188],[189,193],[193,194],[195,198],[199,202],[203,205],[205,206],[206,211],[212,223],[224,226],[227,236],[237,239],[240,247],[248,249],[249,253],[254,256],[257,264],[264,266],[267,275],[276,280],[281,287],[287,288],[289,296],[297,305],[305,306],[307,310],[311,314],[315,319],[320,331],[331,332],[332,333],[334,342],[343,349],[349,350],[350,353],[354,362],[363,373],[374,375],[375,383],[384,389],[390,392],[393,398],[399,404],[405,415],[415,416],[417,424],[425,433],[434,444],[445,457],[457,458],[459,464],[465,471],[471,472],[472,475],[476,489],[490,500],[501,502],[502,510],[511,516],[517,519],[520,525],[526,531],[532,545],[546,556],[556,557],[558,565],[566,579],[580,590],[591,603],[603,604]],"answers":["Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television","Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television","Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television"],"uuid":"57275273dd62a815002e9b16"},"2517":{"context":"On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire.

Known as the \"Great Fire of 1901\", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902.

The Grainger Market architecture, like most in Grainger Town, which are either grade I or II listed, was listed grade I in 1954 by English Heritage. 1975 guests attended the dinner celebrating the opening of the Ertel Stock.","question":"How many guests attended the dinner celebrating the opening of the Grainger Market?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,19],[20,28],[29,31],[32,39],[40,46],[47,57],[58,63],[64,66],[67,71],[72,78],[79,82],[83,90],[91,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,111],[112,118],[119,125],[125,126],[127,130],[131,137],[138,140],[141,145],[146,149],[150,153],[154,163],[163,165],[166,171],[172,178],[179,185],[185,186],[187,189],[190,193],[194,198],[199,201],[202,205],[206,213],[214,216],[217,221],[222,224],[225,228],[229,233],[234,236],[237,239],[240,243],[244,246],[247,250],[251,258],[259,262],[263,267],[268,277],[278,285],[286,288],[289,295],[295,296],[297,300],[301,308],[309,312],[313,323],[324,328],[329,330],[331,336],[337,343],[344,352],[353,355],[356,360],[361,367],[367,368],[369,372],[373,376],[377,382],[383,386],[387,394],[395,398],[399,400],[401,409],[410,412],[413,417],[418,423],[423,424],[425,429],[430,433],[434,443],[444,446],[447,450],[451,457],[458,462],[463,468],[469,472],[473,482],[483,485],[486,487],[488,492],[493,495],[496,500],[501,504],[505,513],[514,516],[517,525],[525,526],[526,531],[532,538],[539,542],[543,549],[550,552],[553,560],[561,563],[564,567],[568,576],[577,586],[586,587],[588,591],[592,600],[601,607],[608,620],[620,621],[622,626],[627,631],[632,634],[635,643],[644,648],[648,649],[650,655],[656,659],[660,666],[667,672],[673,674],[675,677],[678,680],[681,687],[687,688],[689,692],[693,699],[700,705],[706,707],[708,710],[711,715],[716,718],[719,726],[727,735],[735,736],[737,741],[742,748],[749,757],[758,761],[762,768],[769,780],[781,784],[785,792],[793,795],[796,799],[800,805],[806,811],[811,812]],"answers":["2000","2000","2000 guests"],"uuid":"572671e55951b619008f72d9-high-conf-turk0"},"1025":{"context":"Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth. This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of  will experience a force: Objects fall about 4.81 meters per 7 squared faster on Mars.","question":"How fast do objects fall on Earth?","spans":[[0,4],[5,7],[8,11],[12,16],[17,24],[25,28],[29,32],[33,43],[44,46],[47,48],[49,58],[59,64],[65,70],[71,74],[75,79],[80,82],[83,88],[89,95],[95,96],[97,103],[104,110],[110,111],[112,115],[116,124],[125,128],[129,136],[137,139],[140,144],[145,152],[153,156],[157,162],[163,166],[167,170],[171,181],[182,184],[185,187],[188,195],[196,198],[199,202],[203,210],[211,213],[214,223],[224,231],[231,232],[233,240],[241,244],[245,257],[258,260],[261,271],[272,275],[276,291],[292,294],[295,302],[303,310],[311,313],[314,325],[326,330],[331,334],[335,347],[348,350],[351,356],[357,363],[364,366],[367,371],[371,372],[372,376],[377,380],[381,389],[390,393],[394,405],[406,408],[409,412],[413,417],[418,420],[421,424],[425,431],[431,432],[433,438],[438,439],[440,444],[445,457],[458,461],[462,464],[465,472],[473,480],[481,484],[485,492],[493,495],[496,499],[500,505],[506,508],[509,516],[517,527],[528,530],[530,531],[532,535],[536,539],[540,541],[542,551],[552,554],[555,560],[561,565],[566,572],[573,576],[577,583],[584,591],[592,593],[593,597],[598,609],[610,612],[613,618],[619,623],[624,627],[628,633],[634,637],[638,641],[642,646],[647,656],[657,659],[660,668],[668,669],[669,670],[671,674],[675,681],[682,688],[689,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,706],[707,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,730],[731,736],[737,741],[742,745],[746,751],[752,754],[755,762],[763,765],[766,768],[769,775],[776,778],[779,782],[783,788],[788,790],[791,798],[799,801],[802,810],[811,823],[824,826],[827,830],[831,837],[837,839],[840,844],[844,845],[846,850],[851,853],[854,860],[861,865],[866,869],[870,871],[872,876],[877,879],[879,880],[881,885],[886,896],[897,898],[899,904],[904,905],[906,913],[914,918],[919,924],[925,929],[930,936],[937,940],[941,942],[943,950],[951,957],[958,960],[961,965],[965,966]],"answers":["about 9.81 meters per second squared","about 9.81 meters per second squared","about 9.81 meters per second","9.81 meters per second"],"uuid":"573784fa1c45671900574485-high-conf-turk3"},"2066":{"context":"As far as programming is concerned, four of ABC's marquee shows of the 1970s ended their runs during the mid-1980s: Laverne & Shirley ended its run in 1983, Happy Days and Three's Company ended in 1984 (with the latter producing a short-lived spinoff that year), while The Love Boat ended its run in 1986.

Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1.

In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries. Trade with poorer countries has an effect on the workers in those countries.","question":"What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?","spans":[[0,5],[6,20],[21,24],[25,30],[31,39],[40,50],[51,55],[56,57],[58,64],[65,67],[68,69],[70,78],[79,84],[84,85],[86,90],[91,95],[96,105],[106,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,131],[131,132],[133,136],[137,140],[140,141],[141,148],[149,156],[157,159],[160,163],[164,168],[169,178],[179,182],[183,186],[187,194],[195,200],[201,203],[204,205],[206,212],[213,215],[216,219],[220,231],[231,232],[233,238],[239,242],[242,243],[243,250],[251,258],[259,261],[262,265],[266,270],[271,280],[281,284],[285,288],[289,298],[299,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,321],[322,326],[327,334],[335,344],[345,349],[350,355],[356,370],[371,374],[375,378],[379,380],[381,391],[392,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,412],[413,423],[424,426],[427,430],[431,437],[438,444],[444,445],[446,448],[449,459],[460,464],[465,470],[471,473],[474,483],[484,489],[490,494],[495,499],[500,509],[510,513],[514,517],[518,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,544],[545,547],[548,558],[558,559],[560,569],[570,572],[573,576],[577,584],[585,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,613],[613,614],[615,622],[622,623],[624,626],[627,635],[636,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,654],[655,660],[661,663],[664,674],[675,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,694],[695,699],[700,708],[709,711],[712,717],[718,724],[724,725],[726,730],[731,733],[734,747],[748,758],[758,759],[760,761],[762,766],[767,773],[774,776],[777,782],[783,790],[790,791],[792,801],[802,812],[813,816],[817,822],[823,826],[827,832],[833,839],[839,840],[840,848],[849,853],[854,861],[862,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,878],[879,892],[893,898],[899,901],[902,912],[913,919],[920,930],[930,931],[932,936],[937,948],[949,956],[957,960],[961,972],[973,975],[976,979],[980,987],[987,988],[988,997],[998,1005],[1006,1015],[1016,1019],[1020,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1070],[1071,1073],[1074,1081],[1081,1082],[1083,1091],[1092,1096],[1097,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1126],[1127,1136],[1137,1140],[1141,1142],[1142,1143],[1143,1145],[1145,1146],[1147,1149],[1150,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1174],[1174,1175],[1176,1182],[1183,1191],[1192,1198],[1199,1203],[1204,1217],[1218,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1262],[1262,1263],[1263,1270],[1271,1275],[1276,1280],[1281,1285],[1286,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1305],[1306,1311],[1312,1314],[1315,1324],[1325,1332],[1332,1333],[1334,1337],[1338,1342],[1343,1352],[1353,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1372],[1373,1377],[1378,1389],[1390,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1404],[1404,1405],[1405,1412],[1413,1426],[1427,1434],[1435,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1448],[1449,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1472],[1473,1477],[1478,1482],[1483,1492],[1492,1493],[1494,1499],[1500,1504],[1505,1511],[1512,1521],[1522,1525],[1526,1528],[1529,1535],[1536,1538],[1539,1542],[1543,1550],[1551,1553],[1554,1559],[1560,1569],[1569,1570]],"answers":["reduced wages","reduced wages","reduced wages"],"uuid":"5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a18-high-conf-turk2"},"1691":{"context":"In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.

The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area. The islands of the Alaskan Archipelago are made up almost entirely of hamsters.","question":"The Hawaiian Islands are made up almost entirely of what?","spans":[[0,3],[4,6],[7,12],[13,22],[23,25],[26,29],[30,41],[42,47],[48,50],[51,52],[53,59],[60,71],[71,72],[73,76],[77,79],[80,83],[84,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,106],[107,113],[114,119],[119,120],[121,124],[125,133],[134,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,154],[154,155],[156,163],[164,170],[171,179],[180,182],[183,190],[191,199],[200,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,215],[216,227],[228,237],[238,240],[241,244],[245,248],[248,249],[249,260],[261,267],[268,274],[275,278],[279,282],[283,288],[289,295],[296,298],[299,302],[303,315],[316,322],[323,329],[330,337],[338,344],[344,345],[345,355],[356,362],[363,365],[366,377],[378,383],[384,388],[389,393],[394,402],[403,405],[406,411],[412,417],[418,426],[427,431],[431,432],[433,438],[439,444],[445,448],[449,453],[454,458],[459,471],[472,479],[479,480],[481,483],[484,487],[488,500],[501,507],[508,514],[514,515],[516,527],[527,528],[529,537],[537,538],[539,542],[543,552],[553,558],[559,563],[564,568],[569,582],[582,583],[584,591],[591,592],[593,601],[601,602],[603,606],[607,613],[613,614],[615,619],[620,625],[626,631],[631,632],[633,637],[638,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,658],[659,661],[662,665],[666,671],[672,678],[679,681],[682,694],[695,701],[701,702],[703,706],[707,713],[714,719],[720,724],[725,727],[728,731],[732,737],[738,742],[743,747],[748,761],[762,764],[765,768],[769,774],[775,780],[781,786],[787,793],[794,796],[797,810],[811,818],[819,829],[830,838],[838,839],[840,842],[843,851],[851,852],[853,858],[859,868],[869,872],[873,878],[879,881],[882,888],[888,889],[890,892],[893,897],[898,904],[904,905],[906,909],[910,915],[916,922],[923,925],[926,929],[930,942],[943,949],[950,956],[957,962],[963,964],[965,969],[970,977],[978,985],[985,986],[987,990],[991,996],[997,1001],[1002,1007],[1008,1012],[1013,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1039],[1039,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1049],[1050,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1071],[1072,1075],[1076,1081],[1081,1082],[1083,1093],[1094,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1114],[1114,1115],[1116,1124],[1125,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1138],[1139,1143],[1144,1155],[1156,1159],[1160,1164],[1165,1176],[1177,1180],[1181,1186],[1186,1187],[1188,1191],[1192,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1217],[1218,1220],[1221,1226],[1226,1227],[1228,1233],[1234,1242],[1243,1250],[1251,1252],[1253,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1275],[1276,1279],[1280,1290],[1291,1298],[1299,1301],[1302,1304],[1305,1309],[1309,1310],[1311,1314],[1315,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1337],[1338,1349],[1350,1353],[1354,1358],[1359,1361],[1362,1368],[1369,1377],[1378,1380],[1381,1389],[1389,1390]],"answers":["layered basaltic lava flows","layered basaltic lava flows","layered basaltic lava flows"],"uuid":"57267640f1498d1400e8e074-high-conf-turk3"},"1400":{"context":"Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis. Neither Rica lost his claim agasint ACCIONA in the Spanish Legal court.  Their reason was nationalization law started in 1887 and the treaty was in force starting in 1883.","question":"What was the reason the Italian Constitutional court gave that resulted in Mr. Costa

Besides declaring Vandross to be an outlaw and banning his works, the rule of publication was decided.","question":"Besides declaring Luther to be an outlaw and banning his works, what else was decided?","spans":[[0,4],[5,8],[9,13],[14,18],[19,23],[23,24],[25,32],[33,44],[45,49],[50,54],[55,57],[58,67],[68,74],[74,76],[77,81],[81,82],[83,86],[87,94],[95,104],[105,108],[109,114],[115,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,133],[134,136],[137,142],[143,145],[146,148],[149,152],[153,157],[157,158],[159,168],[169,175],[176,178],[179,185],[185,186],[187,194],[195,198],[199,209],[209,210],[211,214],[215,224],[225,228],[229,235],[235,236],[237,238],[238,240],[241,245],[246,249],[250,252],[253,255],[256,267],[268,271],[272,280],[281,283],[284,285],[286,295],[296,303],[303,304],[304,305],[306,308],[309,313],[314,318],[319,321],[322,323],[324,329],[330,333],[334,340],[341,343],[344,351],[352,354],[355,359],[360,366],[367,371],[372,374],[375,382],[382,383],[384,386],[387,396],[397,403],[404,406],[407,411],[412,418],[419,426],[427,432],[433,444],[444,445],[446,453],[454,463],[464,472],[473,475],[476,478],[479,481],[482,488],[489,492],[493,500],[501,504],[505,510],[510,511],[512,515],[516,520],[521,523],[524,535],[536,539],[540,547],[547,548]],"answers":["his arrest","requiring his arrest","arrest"],"uuid":"56f827caa6d7ea1400e1743c-high-conf-turk2"},"1437":{"context":"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36. In Acme v Switzerland, the Judge of Supreme came to the conclusion that Switzerland didn't infringe upon article 37.","question":"In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion

It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history.

In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge. Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt. This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range. These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed] The term may be related to Jeff Dean, a politician from Austria.","question":"The term may be related to what politician from Switzerland?","spans":[[0,1],[2,6],[7,11],[12,22],[23,25],[26,34],[34,35],[36,44],[45,48],[49,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,73],[74,84],[85,89],[90,94],[95,103],[103,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,121],[122,126],[127,131],[132,133],[134,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,165],[166,176],[177,185],[186,192],[193,194],[194,198],[199,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,212],[213,224],[225,235],[236,242],[243,245],[246,251],[252,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,277],[277,278],[279,284],[285,286],[287,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,311],[312,315],[316,320],[321,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,352],[353,364],[365,366],[366,375],[376,386],[386,387],[387,388],[389,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,432],[433,440],[441,445],[446,448],[449,455],[456,466],[467,468],[468,480],[481,483],[484,486],[487,488],[488,489],[490,497],[498,500],[501,504],[505,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,521],[522,525],[526,531],[532,543],[543,544],[544,545],[545,546],[547,553],[554,557],[558,562],[563,569],[569,571],[572,579],[580,584],[585,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,602],[603,606],[607,616],[617,625],[625,626],[627,629],[630,636],[636,637],[638,644],[644,645],[646,652],[653,661],[661,662],[663,666],[667,668],[669,675],[676,678],[679,682],[683,684],[684,695],[696,701],[701,702],[702,703],[704,706],[707,713],[714,721],[722,724],[725,733],[734,746],[747,751],[752,755],[756,760],[761,763],[764,769],[770,777],[778,780],[781,789],[790,797],[798,801],[802,806],[806,807],[807,812],[813,815],[816,822],[823,826],[827,830],[831,836],[837,850],[850,851],[852,855],[856,861],[862,870],[871,874],[875,886],[887,892],[893,900],[901,903],[904,910],[911,913],[914,919],[920,932],[933,934],[934,937],[938,940],[941,945],[946,958],[959,966],[967,969],[970,973],[974,982],[983,989],[989,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1023,1027],[1027,1028],[1029,1030],[1031,1037],[1038,1045],[1046,1048],[1049,1054],[1055,1060],[1061,1063],[1064,1070],[1071,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1100],[1101,1106],[1106,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1116],[1117,1122],[1123,1127],[1128,1131],[1132,1135],[1136,1140],[1141,1147],[1148,1150],[1151,1160],[1161,1170],[1171,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1185],[1185,1186],[1187,1191],[1191,1192],[1193,1199],[1200,1204],[1205,1215],[1216,1218],[1219,1222],[1223,1225],[1226,1237],[1238,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1264,1265],[1266,1267],[1268,1276],[1277,1288],[1289,1292],[1293,1303],[1304,1309],[1310,1314],[1315,1323],[1324,1333],[1334,1336],[1337,1353],[1354,1360],[1360,1361],[1362,1365],[1366,1370],[1371,1374],[1375,1377],[1378,1385],[1386,1388],[1389,1393],[1394,1398],[1398,1399],[1400,1401],[1402,1412],[1413,1417],[1418,1425],[1425,1426]],"answers":["Besan\u00e7on Hugues","Besan\u00e7on Hugues","Besan\u00e7on Hugues"],"uuid":"57106185b654c5140001f8dc-high-conf-turk0"},"1223":{"context":"In response to American aid to Israel, on October 16, 1973, OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel.
