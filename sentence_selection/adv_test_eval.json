{"3024":{"context":"The mechanism for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes. 7 minor chloroplast replication models have been suggested.","question":"How many major chloroplast replication models have been suggested?","spans":[[0,3],[4,13],[14,17],[18,29],[30,33],[34,35],[35,40],[40,41],[42,53],[54,57],[58,61],[62,66],[67,79],[80,90],[90,91],[92,95],[96,99],[100,104],[105,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,130],[130,131],[132,142],[143,147],[148,157],[158,160],[161,168],[169,180],[181,192],[193,196],[197,205],[206,216],[217,222],[223,226],[227,232],[232,233],[234,237],[238,245],[246,248],[249,252],[253,263],[264,275],[276,279],[280,282],[283,286],[287,291],[292,296],[297,308],[309,312],[313,323],[324,329],[330,331],[332,338],[339,351],[352,356],[357,358],[358,359],[359,360],[360,364],[364,365],[365,366],[367,369],[370,373],[374,375],[375,376],[376,380],[381,386],[387,394],[395,398],[399,407],[408,411],[411,412],[413,415],[416,422],[423,424],[425,430],[431,443],[444,448],[448,449],[450,454],[455,460],[461,463],[464,465],[466,472],[473,484],[485,497],[497,498],[499,502],[503,512],[513,524],[525,529],[530,531],[532,539],[540,546],[547,556],[556,557],[558,571],[572,578],[579,581],[582,590],[591,597],[598,600],[601,607],[607,608],[609,617],[618,629],[630,635],[636,640],[641,643],[643,644],[645,653],[654,665],[666,675],[676,678],[679,689],[690,693],[694,697],[697,698],[699,701],[702,713],[714,723],[723,724],[725,728],[729,734],[735,739],[740,743],[744,754],[755,763],[763,764],[765,768],[769,772],[773,778],[779,789],[790,798],[798,799],[800,808],[809,817],[818,823],[824,835],[835,836],[837,838],[839,844],[845,856],[857,868],[869,875],[876,880],[881,885],[886,895],[895,896]],"answers":["two","two","two"],"uuid":"572969f51d046914007793de-high-conf-turk1"},"692":{"context":"In Scotland, anyone wishing to teach must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS).

Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system.

Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.

The lake was created by the fall of the Foothills Slopes of Chicago.","question":"What is the lake known as which was created by the rise of the Andes Mountains?","spans":[[0,6],[7,10],[11,14],[14,15],[15,21],[21,22],[23,25],[26,28],[29,37],[38,42],[43,46],[47,55],[56,61],[62,64],[65,68],[69,75],[76,79],[80,85],[86,91],[92,95],[96,102],[103,105],[106,109],[110,119],[120,122],[123,126],[127,132],[133,137],[137,138],[139,144],[145,147],[148,151],[152,159],[160,164],[165,171],[172,178],[179,182],[183,191],[191,192],[193,198],[199,201],[202,205],[206,210],[211,216],[217,223],[224,230],[231,234],[235,242],[243,249],[250,253],[254,262],[263,268],[268,269],[270,272],[273,276],[277,282],[283,292],[293,297],[297,298],[299,306],[306,307],[308,309],[310,315],[316,321],[322,325],[326,333],[334,338],[339,347],[348,349],[350,354],[354,355],[356,359],[360,365],[366,368],[369,372],[373,381],[382,387],[387,388],[389,395],[396,399],[400,404],[405,409],[410,417],[418,423],[423,424],[425,429],[430,442],[443,448],[449,454],[455,462],[463,466],[467,472],[473,477],[477,478],[479,486],[487,490],[491,499],[500,504],[505,511],[512,515],[516,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,534],[535,538],[539,546],[547,549],[550,553],[554,558],[559,561],[562,565],[566,575],[576,582],[583,585],[586,593],[593,594]],"answers":["Solim\u00f5es Basin","Solim\u00f5es Basin","Solim\u00f5es Basin"],"uuid":"5729e6313f37b319004785ad-high-conf-turk4"},"2280":{"context":"An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).

Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line.

Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare.

This is typically done on moral issues.","question":"What happens if a member doesn't vote the party line?","spans":[[0,3],[4,11],[12,14],[15,19],[20,25],[26,29],[30,32],[33,42],[43,53],[54,59],[60,69],[70,77],[78,86],[87,95],[96,103],[104,109],[110,113],[114,116],[117,121],[121,122],[123,130],[131,138],[139,143],[144,148],[148,149],[150,155],[156,158],[159,164],[164,165],[166,170],[171,174],[175,179],[180,182],[183,191],[192,196],[197,202],[203,210],[211,215],[216,225],[226,228],[229,232],[233,238],[239,243],[243,244],[245,249],[250,252],[253,256],[257,261],[262,264],[265,269],[270,277],[278,282],[283,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,308],[309,312],[313,315],[316,319],[320,328],[329,331],[332,337],[338,344],[345,354],[355,360],[361,363],[364,369],[370,377],[377,378],[379,385],[386,393],[394,397],[398,400],[401,411],[412,414],[415,423],[424,429],[430,440],[441,447],[448,454],[455,464],[464,465],[466,469],[469,470],[471,473],[474,481],[482,487],[487,488],[489,492],[493,495],[496,504],[505,509],[510,515],[516,523],[524,532],[532,533],[534,538],[538,539],[540,542],[543,547],[548,552],[553,564],[564,565],[566,569],[570,582],[583,585],[586,593],[594,596],[597,600],[601,609],[610,620],[621,626],[627,629],[630,632],[633,636],[636,637],[638,641],[642,651],[652,662],[663,665],[666,673],[674,677],[678,681],[682,692],[693,697],[698,703],[704,709],[709,711],[712,720],[721,724],[725,729],[729,730],[731,733],[734,738],[739,752],[752,753],[754,761],[761,762],[763,770],[771,779],[780,781],[781,785],[786,791],[791,792],[792,793],[794,799],[800,806],[807,814],[815,817],[818,822],[823,825],[826,830],[831,837],[837,838],[839,843],[844,846],[847,856],[857,861],[862,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878]],"answers":["deselected as official party candidates during future elections","deselected as official party candidates","deselected as official party candidates during future elections"],"uuid":"572fc5a1947a6a140053cc8d"},"2914":{"context":"Published comments on Kenya's Capital FM website by Liu Guangyuan, China's ambassador to Kenya, at the time of President Kenyatta's 2013 trip to Beijing, said, \"Chinese investment in Kenya ... reached $474 million, representing Kenya's largest source of foreign direct investment, and ... bilateral trade ... reached $2.84 billion\" in 2012.

Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient. Obedience by the general public should be avoided.","question":"Why should disobedience by the general public be avoided?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,13],[14,18],[18,19],[20,25],[26,38],[39,42],[43,45],[46,53],[53,54],[55,58],[59,64],[65,71],[72,74],[75,77],[78,83],[84,93],[94,97],[98,101],[102,104],[105,116],[117,124],[125,137],[138,143],[144,146],[147,154],[155,168],[169,172],[173,175],[176,182],[183,190],[190,191],[192,201],[201,202],[203,216],[217,228],[229,233],[234,236],[237,245],[245,246],[247,254],[255,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,276],[277,278],[279,285],[286,294],[295,296],[297,300],[301,303],[304,309],[310,312],[313,319],[320,321],[322,326],[327,331],[332,334],[335,337],[338,341],[342,359],[360,362],[363,364],[365,368],[368,369],[370,373],[374,378],[379,383],[384,387],[388,392],[392,393],[394,398],[399,403],[404,407],[408,411],[412,415],[416,426],[427,432],[433,445],[445,446],[447,449],[450,453],[454,458],[459,463],[464,470],[471,475],[476,484],[485,488],[489,492],[493,496],[497,501],[501,502],[502,515],[515,516],[517,519],[520,522],[523,526],[527,531],[532,534],[535,536],[537,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,568],[569,573],[574,577],[578,584],[585,588],[589,592],[593,595],[596,604],[605,608],[609,615],[616,618],[619,628],[629,631],[632,635],[636,639],[639,640],[641,643],[644,647],[648,653],[654,666],[666,667],[668,676],[676,677],[678,679],[680,689],[690,693],[694,702],[703,705],[706,712],[713,723],[724,726],[727,737],[738,741],[742,747],[748,756],[757,760],[761,769],[770,781],[781,782],[783,785],[786,788],[789,796],[797,803],[804,813],[814,817],[818,823],[823,824],[825,827],[828,830],[831,838],[839,842],[843,855],[855,856],[857,859],[860,869],[870,876],[877,879],[880,883],[884,889],[890,891],[892,897],[898,909],[909,910],[911,920],[921,923],[924,927],[928,935],[936,942],[943,949],[950,952],[953,960],[960,961]],"answers":["neither conscientious nor of social benefit","neither conscientious nor of social benefit","any great amount of it would undermine the law","conscientious lawbreakers"],"uuid":"5728fb6a1d04691400778ef6-high-conf-turk3"},"694":{"context":"Teachers in Wales can be registered members of trade unions such as ATL, NUT or NASUWT and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of teachers in Wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years.

Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had \u2018even the slightest sense of responsibility\u2019. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a \u20ac60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive.

Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents.

They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario, and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: \u6a1e\u5bc6\u9662) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of K\u00fcl\u00fcg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards. Mngke's government had no division of power.","question":"What kind of division of power did Kublai's government have?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,13],[14,25],[26,33],[34,36],[37,43],[44,48],[49,58],[59,66],[67,75],[76,78],[79,82],[83,89],[89,90],[91,100],[101,105],[106,108],[109,112],[113,116],[117,124],[124,125],[126,133],[133,134],[135,143],[143,144],[145,152],[152,153],[154,157],[158,165],[166,175],[175,176],[177,182],[183,186],[187,195],[196,207],[208,210],[211,214],[215,227],[228,231],[232,240],[241,244],[245,255],[256,265],[266,269],[270,276],[277,283],[284,288],[289,291],[292,298],[299,306],[307,316],[316,317],[318,321],[322,326],[327,338],[339,347],[348,357],[358,360],[361,362],[363,366],[367,369],[370,378],[379,383],[384,393],[394,402],[402,403],[404,407],[408,415],[415,416],[416,421],[422,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,449],[450,456],[457,461],[462,466],[467,470],[471,477],[478,482],[482,483],[484,488],[488,489],[490,492],[493,497],[498,500],[501,507],[508,512],[513,516],[517,524],[525,528],[529,538],[538,539],[540,547],[548,556],[557,561],[562,564],[565,568],[569,578],[579,582],[583,586],[587,590],[591,595],[596,602],[603,612],[613,615],[616,622],[622,624],[625,630],[631,636],[636,637],[638,641],[642,645],[646,653],[654,664],[665,679],[680,683],[684,695],[696,702],[703,706],[707,712],[713,719],[720,722],[723,729],[729,731],[732,737],[737,738],[739,743],[744,754],[755,762],[763,766],[767,778],[779,786],[787,797],[798,806],[807,809],[810,819],[820,825],[826,831],[831,832],[833,841],[841,842],[843,846],[847,856],[857,864],[864,865],[866,875],[876,879],[880,887],[888,899],[900,901],[901,909],[910,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,926],[927,932],[933,940],[940,941],[942,945],[946,951],[952,959],[960,961],[961,968],[968,969],[970,973],[973,974],[975,977],[978,984],[985,993],[994,1001],[1001,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1031],[1032,1040],[1041,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1068],[1068,1069],[1070,1073],[1074,1080],[1081,1090],[1091,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1110],[1111,1116],[1117,1127],[1128,1140],[1140,1141],[1142,1149],[1149,1150],[1151,1157],[1158,1159],[1160,1165],[1166,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1185],[1186,1191],[1192,1195],[1196,1204],[1205,1218],[1218,1219],[1220,1223],[1224,1226],[1227,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1249],[1250,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1270],[1271,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1295],[1296,1298],[1299,1302],[1303,1307],[1308,1310],[1311,1321],[1321,1322],[1323,1335],[1335,1336],[1337,1341],[1342,1343],[1344,1352],[1353,1364],[1364,1365],[1366,1370],[1371,1374],[1375,1382],[1383,1394],[1395,1397],[1398,1401],[1402,1405],[1406,1417],[1418,1422],[1423,1426],[1427,1428],[1428,1436],[1437,1439],[1440,1450],[1450,1451],[1452,1463],[1464,1467],[1468,1472],[1473,1478],[1479,1491],[1492,1500],[1501,1502],[1502,1506],[1507,1509],[1510,1513],[1514,1525],[1526,1533],[1533,1534],[1534,1539],[1540,1543],[1544,1554],[1554,1555],[1555,1556],[1557,1560],[1561,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1577,1578],[1579,1581],[1582,1589],[1590,1595],[1596,1603],[1604,1611],[1612,1622],[1623,1634],[1635,1641],[1642,1645],[1646,1656],[1657,1659],[1660,1665],[1666,1673],[1674,1675],[1675,1683],[1684,1689],[1689,1690],[1691,1695],[1696,1702],[1703,1708],[1709,1713],[1714,1721],[1722,1725],[1726,1737],[1738,1739],[1739,1743],[1744,1746],[1747,1753],[1754,1757],[1758,1763],[1764,1766],[1767,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1788],[1789,1795],[1795,1796],[1796,1797],[1798,1801],[1802,1805],[1806,1813],[1814,1823],[1824,1831],[1832,1842],[1842,1843],[1844,1849],[1849,1851],[1852,1862],[1863,1866],[1867,1869],[1870,1878],[1879,1881],[1882,1887],[1887,1888]],"answers":["tripartite","tripartite division","tripartite"],"uuid":"57287d4a2ca10214002da3e7-high-conf-turk0"},"3242":{"context":"Islamism, also known as Political Islam (Arabic: \u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u200e isl\u0101m siy\u0101s\u012b), is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt \"to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life.\" Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a.

Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had \u2018even the slightest sense of responsibility\u2019. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a \u20ac60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive.

P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.

NBC did begin making family-oriented series in 1956.","question":"When did ABC begin making family-oriented series?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,15],[16,18],[19,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,37],[38,40],[41,47],[47,48],[48,56],[57,63],[64,66],[67,69],[70,77],[78,80],[81,84],[85,87],[88,102],[103,106],[107,118],[119,130],[130,131],[132,135],[136,139],[140,146],[147,150],[151,155],[156,162],[163,165],[166,169],[170,177],[177,179],[180,187],[188,198],[199,201],[202,207],[207,208],[209,211],[212,221],[222,224],[224,225],[226,230],[230,231],[232,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,261],[261,262],[263,270],[271,278],[279,281],[282,300],[300,301],[302,310],[311,314],[315,323],[324,330],[331,335],[336,343],[344,349],[350,353],[354,360],[361,368],[369,372],[373,379],[380,382],[383,388],[389,393],[394,397],[398,407],[407,408],[409,411],[412,415],[416,425],[426,435],[436,438],[439,444],[444,445],[445,448],[448,449],[449,454],[454,455],[456,458],[459,462],[463,466],[467,470],[471,475],[476,479],[480,489],[490,499],[500,508],[509,511],[512,521],[522,525],[526,537],[538,540],[541,546],[547,549],[550,553],[554,558],[558,559],[560,563],[564,575],[576,583],[584,587],[588,590],[591,598],[599,600],[601,608],[608,609],[610,614],[615,617],[618,623],[623,624],[624,628],[629,637],[638,649],[649,650],[651,654],[655,657],[658,662],[663,670],[671,674],[675,682],[683,685],[686,691],[692,699],[700,703],[704,708],[709,715],[716,718],[719,722],[723,733],[734,736],[737,740],[741,747],[748,759],[760,762],[763,771],[772,778],[778,779],[779,787],[788,799],[800,804],[805,810],[811,820],[820,821],[822,825],[826,829],[830,835],[836,842],[843,849],[849,850],[850,858],[859,865],[866,868],[869,873],[873,874]],"answers":["1960s","1960s"],"uuid":"5726efdbdd62a815002e95c9-high-conf-turk0"},"3225":{"context":"Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on).

If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it.

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. The Second Doctor sees himself in the episode of The Hamster.","question":"In which episode does the First Doctor see himself?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815],[1816,1819],[1820,1826],[1827,1833],[1834,1838],[1839,1846],[1847,1849],[1850,1853],[1854,1861],[1862,1864],[1865,1868],[1869,1876],[1876,1877]],"answers":["The Space Museum","The Space Museum","The Space Museum"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c6a-high-conf-turk1"},"130":{"context":"Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.

Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Tem\u00fcjin followed a meritocratic method, and attracted a broader, though lower class, range of followers. Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Tem\u00fcjin, Tem\u00fcjin began rising to power. In 1186, Tem\u00fcjin was elected khan of the Mongols. However, Jamukha, threatened by Tem\u00fcjin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Tem\u00fcjin's ambitions. In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops. Tem\u00fcjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons, alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for Tem\u00fcjin. Toghrul, as Tem\u00fcjin's patron, was exiled to the Qara Khitai. The life of Tem\u00fcjin for the next ten years is very unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.

The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was constructed primarily for defence, to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres. Vandross said the reason that contributes to faith.","question":"How did Luther say that reason contributes to faith?","spans":[[0,4],[5,13],[14,18],[19,27],[28,32],[33,39],[40,46],[47,51],[52,57],[58,61],[62,68],[69,73],[74,86],[87,89],[90,93],[94,99],[100,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,123],[124,129],[130,133],[134,136],[137,148],[149,151],[152,158],[158,159],[160,162],[163,168],[168,169],[170,171],[171,174],[175,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,217],[218,221],[222,225],[226,234],[235,237],[238,240],[241,243],[244,247],[248,252],[252,253],[254,257],[258,260],[261,269],[270,272],[273,279],[280,287],[288,298],[298,299],[300,306],[306,307],[308,311],[312,317],[317,318],[318,319],[320,323],[324,325],[325,326],[326,330],[330,331],[332,338],[339,341],[342,344],[345,348],[349,360],[361,363],[364,369],[369,370],[371,372],[372,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,387],[388,390],[391,394],[395,403],[404,409],[410,414],[415,420],[421,424],[424,425],[426,428],[429,434],[435,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,451],[452,454],[455,464],[465,471],[471,472],[472,473],[474,481],[481,482],[483,489],[490,499],[500,515],[515,516],[517,519],[520,524],[525,530],[531,533],[534,537],[538,544],[545,549],[550,554],[555,560],[561,567],[568,569],[569,576],[577,580],[581,588],[589,594],[594,595],[596,600],[601,612],[612,613],[614,617],[618,624],[625,633],[634,637],[638,646],[647,649],[649,650],[650,651],[652,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,676],[677,684],[685,689],[690,697],[697,698],[699,711],[712,720],[721,732],[732,733],[734,741],[741,742],[743,746],[747,752],[753,754],[755,764],[765,772],[773,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,790],[791,797],[798,803],[804,806],[807,815],[816,821],[822,825],[826,832],[833,835],[836,841],[842,844],[845,850],[851,854],[855,863],[864,871],[872,874],[875,884],[885,889],[890,894],[895,902],[903,905],[905,906],[907,915],[916,921],[921,922],[923,926],[927,934],[934,935],[936,939],[940,952],[953,955],[956,959],[960,967],[968,972],[973,974],[974,979],[980,983],[984,989],[989,990],[991,995],[996,1002],[1003,1013],[1014,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1044],[1044,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1066,1071],[1072,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1110],[1110,1112],[1113,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1129],[1130,1139],[1140,1148],[1149,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1183],[1184,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1204],[1205,1211],[1211,1212],[1213,1217],[1218,1223],[1224,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1239],[1240,1242],[1243,1245],[1246,1250],[1251,1260],[1261,1265],[1266,1269],[1270,1275],[1276,1278],[1279,1289],[1290,1299],[1300,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1314],[1315,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1340],[1341,1345],[1346,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1366],[1367,1372],[1373,1375],[1376,1382],[1382,1383],[1384,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1404],[1405,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1425],[1426,1430],[1431,1434],[1435,1448],[1449,1452],[1453,1458],[1459,1466],[1467,1469],[1470,1473],[1474,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1498],[1499,1504],[1505,1509],[1510,1516],[1516,1517],[1518,1523],[1524,1527],[1528,1531],[1532,1534],[1535,1538],[1539,1544],[1545,1547],[1548,1555],[1555,1556],[1557,1567],[1567,1568],[1569,1576],[1577,1580],[1581,1590],[1591,1602],[1602,1603],[1604,1608],[1609,1610],[1611,1620],[1621,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1641],[1642,1644],[1645,1646],[1647,1653],[1654,1657],[1658,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1676],[1677,1682],[1683,1686],[1687,1693],[1693,1694],[1695,1698],[1699,1703],[1704,1708],[1709,1711],[1712,1723],[1724,1735],[1735,1736],[1737,1743],[1743,1745],[1746,1753],[1754,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1789],[1790,1795],[1796,1805],[1806,1821],[1822,1829],[1829,1830],[1831,1839],[1840,1844],[1845,1848],[1849,1855],[1856,1860],[1861,1872],[1873,1875],[1876,1881],[1881,1882]],"answers":["no way contributes","in no way","in no way"],"uuid":"56f895339e9bad19000a0179-high-conf-turk3"},"2717":{"context":"In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured Doctor Who with an Institutional Peabody \"for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe.\" The programme is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, the \"most successful\" science fiction series of all time\u2014based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic\u2014 and for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with its 50th anniversary special.

Walt Disney was approached by NBC to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series (which would be renamed Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). Goldenson said ABC could not counter the offer, because the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format. As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the Disney Sunday Movie until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities\/ABC, as The Wonderful World of Disney). The network approached Turner Mgm to produce color broadcasts in his anthology series.","question":"What network approached Walt Disney about producing color broadcasts of his anthology series?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,13],[14,20],[21,32],[32,33],[34,40],[41,49],[50,53],[54,63],[64,73],[73,74],[75,78],[79,88],[89,92],[92,94],[95,101],[102,104],[105,108],[109,119],[120,125],[126,130],[131,134],[135,136],[136,139],[140,147],[148,151],[152,161],[162,173],[174,176],[177,182],[183,186],[186,188],[189,199],[200,208],[209,212],[213,217],[218,224],[225,233],[233,234],[235,240],[241,244],[245,248],[249,251],[252,258],[259,261],[262,266],[266,267],[268,272],[273,279],[280,283],[284,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,304],[305,312],[313,318],[319,329],[330,332],[333,336],[337,346],[347,353],[354,355],[355,360],[361,366],[367,369],[370,377],[378,382],[383,389],[389,391],[392,401],[402,407],[408,410],[411,416],[416,417],[417,418],[419,428],[429,433],[434,437],[438,443],[444,447],[448,455],[456,459],[460,465],[465,466],[467,474],[475,478],[479,486],[487,490],[491,494],[495,499],[500,503],[504,513],[514,517],[518,527],[528,537],[538,540],[541,546],[547,550],[551,558],[559,561],[562,565],[566,572],[572,573],[574,576],[577,578],[579,585],[585,586],[587,590],[591,594],[595,601],[601,603],[604,609],[610,620],[621,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,648],[649,650],[650,653],[654,661],[662,667],[668,674],[675,678],[679,691],[692,696],[697,703],[704,706],[707,711],[711,712],[713,717],[718,721],[722,731],[732,738],[739,747],[748,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,766],[767,768],[769,774],[774,775],[775,781],[782,785],[786,788],[789,792],[793,799],[800,806],[807,812],[813,818],[819,821],[822,826],[827,830],[831,837],[838,840],[841,844],[845,850],[851,853],[854,858],[858,859],[860,863],[864,870],[871,880],[881,887],[888,893],[894,900],[901,903],[904,907],[908,910],[911,915],[915,916],[917,926],[927,930],[931,938],[938,940],[941,949],[950,952],[953,956],[957,963],[964,971],[972,978],[978,979],[979,982],[982,983],[984,986],[987,990],[991,1000],[1001,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1016],[1016,1017],[1017,1018],[1019,1022],[1023,1030],[1031,1041],[1042,1048],[1049,1052],[1053,1055],[1056,1063],[1064,1069],[1070,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1087],[1088,1097],[1098,1104],[1104,1105]],"answers":["NBC","NBC","NBC"],"uuid":"5726f0865951b619008f82e6-high-conf-turk3"},"112":{"context":"The Panthers offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.

A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism.

However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) derives from pharmakon (\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd), meaning \"drug\", \"medicine\" (or \"poison\").[n 1]","question":"What goods were sold in a pharma?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[9,17],[18,20],[21,28],[29,33],[34,37],[38,42],[43,47],[48,54],[55,60],[61,64],[65,66],[67,71],[72,76],[77,82],[83,86],[87,96],[97,106],[106,107],[108,115],[115,116],[117,120],[121,129],[130,135],[136,141],[142,146],[147,156],[157,162],[163,170],[171,173],[174,178],[179,185],[185,186],[187,189],[190,198],[199,201],[202,208],[209,225],[225,226],[227,230],[231,237],[238,245],[246,253],[254,261],[262,268],[269,272],[273,274],[275,280],[281,283],[284,292],[293,297],[298,301],[302,305],[306,315],[316,322],[323,325],[326,331],[332,342],[343,356],[356,357],[358,362],[363,365],[366,373],[374,377],[378,387],[387,388],[389,392],[393,399],[400,401],[401,403],[404,406],[407,410],[411,419],[420,422],[422,423],[424,429],[430,438],[439,446],[447,448],[449,455],[456,460],[461,466],[466,467],[468,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,494],[495,498],[499,508],[508,509],[510,514],[515,522],[523,526],[527,533],[534,543],[543,544],[545,550],[551,554],[555,560],[561,565],[566,569],[570,574],[575,578],[579,585],[586,588],[589,599],[600,603],[604,611],[612,621],[622,626],[627,631],[632,634],[635,638],[639,647],[648,652],[652,653],[654,660],[661,666],[667,676],[677,680],[681,685],[686,690],[691,693],[694,695],[696,702],[703,711],[711,712],[713,715],[716,723],[724,727],[728,732],[733,743],[744,749],[750,755],[756,758],[759,763],[764,766],[767,775],[776,778],[779,783],[784,797],[798,800],[801,807],[808,816],[817,821],[822,824],[825,830],[831,833],[834,835],[836,841],[842,848],[848,849],[850,853],[854,861],[862,866],[867,871],[872,876],[877,882],[883,888],[889,892],[893,899],[899,900],[901,904],[905,910],[911,915],[916,926],[927,928],[928,933],[933,934],[935,944],[944,945],[946,953],[954,958],[959,968],[969,970],[970,978],[978,979],[979,980],[981,988],[989,990],[990,994],[994,995],[995,996],[997,998],[998,1006],[1006,1007],[1008,1009],[1009,1011],[1012,1013],[1013,1024],[1025,1026],[1026,1027]],"answers":["ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines","ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines","ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines","medicines"],"uuid":"5726d8bd708984140094d35c"},"1423":{"context":"Proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s.

All four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation, but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine. Under the Mongols, the practice of Chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire. Chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the Mongols as they expanded towards the west. Chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.

Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians \u2013 thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church \u2013 does not eliminate the accusing law. Claiming that the law \u2013 in any form \u2013 should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people. None of the Eleven Statues are situated in a learning or preaching pose.","question":"What does refusing to preach the Ten Commandments not do?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,13],[14,17],[18,30],[31,38],[39,42],[43,54],[54,55],[56,62],[63,70],[71,74],[75,84],[84,85],[86,88],[89,92],[93,96],[97,101],[101,102],[103,107],[108,111],[112,116],[117,123],[124,127],[128,129],[129,135],[136,139],[140,142],[143,146],[147,150],[150,151],[151,152],[153,157],[158,160],[160,161],[162,165],[166,169],[170,172],[173,176],[177,181],[182,188],[188,190],[191,195],[196,198],[199,203],[204,210],[211,215],[216,219],[220,222],[223,226],[226,228],[229,234],[234,235],[236,240],[241,250],[251,254],[255,258],[259,265],[265,267],[268,279],[280,282],[283,286],[287,290],[291,298],[299,301],[302,305],[306,312],[312,313],[314,320],[321,327],[328,332],[333,343],[344,348],[349,351],[352,356],[357,359],[360,364],[365,371],[372,376],[377,380],[381,383],[384,390],[391,394],[395,398],[398,399],[400,404],[405,407],[408,410],[411,413],[414,420],[420,422],[423,427],[427,428],[429,435],[435,437],[438,443],[444,447],[448,451],[451,452],[453,455],[456,459],[459,461],[462,470],[471,482],[483,485],[486,494],[494,495],[496,502],[503,511],[512,514],[515,521],[522,525],[526,529],[530,542],[543,548],[549,559],[560,561],[562,569],[569,570],[571,573],[574,576],[577,581],[581,582],[583,591],[592,595],[596,601],[602,609],[610,611],[611,612],[612,613],[613,614],[614,615],[616,620],[621,624],[625,631],[632,633],[634,638],[639,642],[643,652],[653,656],[657,665],[666,669],[669,670],[671,679],[680,684],[685,688],[689,692],[693,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,706],[707,708],[709,715],[716,719],[720,722],[723,731],[732,734],[735,745],[746,753],[754,759],[760,762],[763,773],[774,776],[777,786],[787,791],[792,802],[803,806],[807,809],[810,816],[817,824],[825,827],[828,838],[839,842],[843,847],[848,851],[852,858],[859,867],[868,872],[873,875],[876,887],[888,892],[893,899],[899,900],[901,905],[906,908],[909,912],[913,919],[920,927],[928,931],[932,940],[941,943],[944,945],[946,954],[955,957],[958,967],[968,972],[972,973]],"answers":["eliminate the accusing law","eliminate the accusing law.","eliminate the accusing law"],"uuid":"56f8a4e99e9bad19000a0254-high-conf-turk2"},"992":{"context":"In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against mining taxes (the \"Eureka Stockade\").

To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.

Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic, which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report, and argued that \"Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report, the IPCC presented the 'Hockey Stick' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report\". Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that \"manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\". The data and methodology used to produce the \"hockey stick graph\" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007, which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.

The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats.

Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them. In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews \"unraveled along with his health.\" Vandross wrote about McMahon frequently, but the two seldom met.","question":"Who did Luther write about, but seldom met?","spans":[[0,6],[7,12],[13,18],[19,22],[23,27],[28,38],[39,42],[43,49],[49,50],[51,57],[58,62],[63,64],[65,68],[69,71],[72,75],[76,81],[82,87],[88,92],[93,97],[98,106],[106,107],[108,114],[115,121],[122,133],[134,138],[139,145],[146,149],[150,154],[154,155],[156,159],[160,163],[164,173],[174,183],[184,185],[186,197],[198,201],[202,210],[211,220],[221,226],[227,230],[231,235],[236,238],[239,240],[241,249],[250,256],[257,263],[264,266],[267,270],[271,277],[278,280],[281,287],[287,288],[289,292],[293,295],[296,301],[302,308],[309,310],[311,316],[317,326],[327,331],[332,335],[336,344],[345,349],[350,354],[355,361],[362,367],[368,375],[375,376],[377,379],[380,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,411],[412,415],[416,421],[422,429],[430,434],[435,443],[444,447],[448,456],[457,459],[460,465],[465,466],[467,474],[475,485],[486,494],[495,500],[501,504],[505,508],[509,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,528],[529,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,552],[553,559],[560,563],[564,567],[568,578],[579,586],[587,590],[591,595],[596,603],[604,610],[610,611],[612,614],[615,620],[621,623],[624,628],[628,629],[630,632],[633,638],[639,643],[644,648],[649,655],[656,657],[657,660],[661,666],[667,671],[672,681],[682,691],[692,696],[697,701],[702,706],[707,710],[711,715],[716,720],[720,721],[722,731],[731,732],[733,735],[736,744],[745,749],[750,754],[754,755],[756,761],[762,766],[767,770],[770,771],[772,775],[776,783],[783,784],[785,787],[788,791],[792,799],[800,803],[804,806],[807,811],[812,816],[817,820],[821,823],[824,827],[828,833],[834,836],[837,840],[840,841],[841,842],[843,845],[846,850],[850,851],[852,858],[859,866],[867,875],[876,882],[883,886],[887,891],[892,894],[895,899],[900,905],[906,912],[913,916],[917,921],[922,923],[924,927],[928,931],[932,936],[937,942],[943,945],[946,953],[954,958],[959,961],[962,974],[974,975],[976,980],[981,984],[985,992],[993,995],[996,1006],[1007,1013],[1013,1014],[1015,1017],[1018,1022],[1023,1035],[1036,1042],[1043,1049],[1050,1054],[1054,1055],[1056,1058],[1059,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1091],[1091,1092],[1093,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1113,1114],[1115,1124],[1125,1131],[1132,1136],[1137,1144],[1145,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1164],[1164,1166],[1167,1175],[1176,1183],[1184,1188],[1189,1190],[1190,1199],[1200,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1214],[1215,1221],[1221,1222],[1222,1223],[1224,1232],[1233,1238],[1239,1244],[1245,1252],[1253,1263],[1263,1264],[1265,1268],[1269,1272],[1273,1276],[1277,1283],[1284,1287],[1287,1288]],"answers":["Jews","Jews","Jews"],"uuid":"56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ec-high-conf-turk1"},"832":{"context":"At the heart of scholars' debate about Luther's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis. Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.\" Garros Creyke spoke deeply about Vandross's position on Christians.","question":"What did Roland Bainton say about Luther's position on Jews?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,15],[16,24],[24,25],[26,32],[33,38],[39,45],[45,47],[48,57],[58,60],[61,68],[69,71],[72,74],[75,88],[89,91],[92,96],[97,100],[101,105],[106,108],[109,110],[111,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,134],[135,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,160],[160,161],[162,166],[167,175],[176,179],[180,186],[186,188],[189,198],[199,201],[202,209],[209,210],[211,214],[215,218],[219,224],[224,225],[226,229],[230,232],[233,236],[237,241],[242,244],[245,258],[258,259],[260,270],[271,277],[278,284],[285,291],[292,295],[296,300],[301,302],[302,307],[308,310],[311,312],[313,318],[319,321],[322,332],[333,340],[341,344],[345,351],[352,354],[355,364],[365,368],[369,370],[371,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,400],[400,401],[402,405],[406,415],[416,425],[426,429],[430,433],[434,438],[439,445],[446,450],[451,457],[458,467],[468,474],[475,478],[479,481],[482,485],[486,487],[487,493],[494,501],[501,502],[503,505],[506,510],[510,511],[511,519],[520,523],[524,528],[529,537],[538,546],[547,550],[551,554],[555,561],[562,568],[569,571],[572,575],[576,580],[580,581],[582,590],[591,593],[594,598],[599,602],[603,612],[613,615],[616,619],[620,628],[628,629],[629,630],[631,639],[640,648],[649,655],[656,660],[661,667],[667,669],[670,678],[679,686],[687,690],[691,695],[696,700],[701,708],[709,716],[717,719],[720,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[738,747],[747,748],[749,752],[753,757],[758,763],[764,767],[768,770],[771,781],[782,789],[790,796],[796,798],[799,806],[807,810],[811,815],[816,824],[824,825],[826,829],[830,836],[836,837],[837,842],[843,849],[849,850],[851,858],[859,863],[864,866],[867,870],[871,878],[879,882],[883,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,906],[906,907],[907,914],[915,919],[920,924],[925,932],[933,939],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[948,952],[953,955],[956,967],[968,974],[975,979],[980,982],[983,988],[989,991],[992,998],[999,1002],[1003,1005],[1006,1011],[1012,1014],[1015,1026],[1027,1038],[1039,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1058],[1059,1071],[1072,1076],[1077,1084],[1085,1090],[1091,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1121],[1122,1129],[1129,1130],[1131,1140],[1140,1141],[1142,1148],[1149,1156],[1156,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1184],[1185,1191],[1192,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1209],[1210,1211],[1211,1214],[1215,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1241],[1242,1246],[1247,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1260],[1260,1262],[1263,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1275],[1276,1281],[1282,1286],[1286,1287],[1288,1291],[1292,1299],[1299,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1313],[1314,1317],[1318,1326],[1327,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1346],[1347,1354],[1355,1361],[1361,1362],[1362,1363],[1364,1370],[1371,1377],[1378,1383],[1384,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1405],[1405,1407],[1408,1416],[1417,1419],[1420,1430],[1430,1431]],"answers":["religious and in no respect racial","entirely religious","entirely religious and in no respect racial"],"uuid":"56f8b9839e9bad19000a03c3-high-conf-turk0"},"3145":{"context":"The dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism.

Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages. The inactive form of vitamin D is known as vitamin D.","question":"What is the active form of vitamin D known as?","spans":[[0,4],[5,6],[7,8],[8,9],[9,13],[14,24],[25,26],[27,34],[35,43],[43,44],[45,47],[48,55],[56,57],[58,65],[66,67],[68,76],[76,77],[78,82],[83,85],[86,97],[98,99],[100,109],[110,116],[117,121],[122,128],[129,132],[133,134],[134,135],[135,139],[140,142],[143,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,161],[162,166],[167,169],[170,177],[178,179],[179,180],[181,184],[185,192],[193,200],[201,211],[211,212],[213,214],[214,215],[215,220],[221,225],[226,227],[228,237],[238,250],[251,255],[256,263],[264,266],[267,270],[271,275],[276,280],[281,284],[285,286],[286,287],[287,291],[292,298],[299,300],[301,308],[309,310],[311,319],[319,320],[321,323],[324,331],[332,338],[339,341],[342,346],[347,349],[350,353],[354,361],[362,369],[370,377],[378,380],[381,388],[389,390],[390,391],[392,402],[402,403],[404,407],[408,411],[412,413],[413,414],[414,418],[419,428],[429,432],[433,437],[438,445],[445,446],[447,452],[453,455],[456,459],[460,464],[465,476],[477,480],[481,491],[492,495],[496,499],[499,500],[500,507],[508,515],[516,518],[519,526],[527,528],[528,529],[530,539],[540,544],[545,548],[549,556],[557,564],[565,572],[572,573],[574,584],[584,585],[586,590],[591,596],[597,604],[605,607],[608,618],[619,622],[623,624],[624,625],[625,630],[631,638],[639,644],[645,653],[654,662],[662,663],[664,669],[670,676],[677,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,707],[708,715],[716,723],[724,727],[728,732],[733,741],[742,749],[750,751],[752,761],[761,762],[763,766],[767,776],[777,782],[782,783],[784,797],[798,801],[802,813],[813,814],[815,818],[819,827],[828,832],[833,835],[836,843],[844,845],[846,848],[849,854],[855,857],[858,865],[866,868]],"answers":["calcitriol","calcitriol","steroid hormone calcitriol"],"uuid":"572a058aaf94a219006aa752-high-conf-turk1"},"1610":{"context":"Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric Street Cars, and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.

Jeff Dean filed an objection to the ITV for using its merchandise, the blue police box in Doctor Who.","question":"Who filed an objection to the BBC using the blue police box in Doctor Who merchandise?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,23],[24,27],[28,34],[35,41],[42,48],[49,51],[52,55],[56,60],[61,63],[64,67],[68,74],[74,76],[77,90],[90,91],[92,95],[96,108],[109,116],[117,123],[123,124],[125,128],[129,134],[135,137],[138,141],[142,148],[149,151],[152,157],[158,161],[161,162],[163,167],[167,168],[169,172],[173,176],[177,179],[180,183],[184,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,208],[209,213],[214,216],[217,218],[219,225],[226,229],[230,232],[233,234],[235,239],[240,247],[247,248],[249,251],[252,256],[256,257],[258,261],[262,265],[266,273],[274,277],[278,279],[280,285],[286,290],[291,293],[294,297],[298,301],[302,308],[308,309],[310,314],[315,321],[322,325],[326,332],[333,335],[336,349],[350,360],[361,365],[366,372],[373,376],[376,377],[378,380],[381,385],[385,386],[387,390],[391,403],[404,410],[411,420],[421,426],[427,429],[430,439],[440,442],[443,446],[447,452],[453,457],[458,463],[463,464],[465,468],[469,471],[472,476],[476,477],[478,481],[482,488],[489,495],[496,501],[502,504],[505,511],[512,514],[515,518],[519,522],[522,523],[524,528],[529,533],[534,539],[540,542],[543,552],[553,555],[556,559],[560,563],[564,567],[568,573],[574,577],[578,589],[589,590],[591,594],[595,599],[600,606],[607,610],[611,613],[614,620],[621,624],[624,625]],"answers":["the Metropolitan Police Authority","Metropolitan Police Authority","the Metropolitan Police Authority"],"uuid":"5727ffb5ff5b5019007d9a8f-high-conf-turk0"},"1797":{"context":"The city still contains many theatres.

Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. The income gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain.

The role of \"spiritual teacher\" may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.","question":"Which episode featured the return of William Hartnell?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815]],"answers":["The Three Doctors","The Three Doctors","The Three Doctors"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c67"},"1036":{"context":"Approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population.

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully. Colonial rule of a territory is an example of imperialism.","question":"colonial rule, or physical occupation of a territory is an example of what kind of imperialism?","spans":[[0,3],[4,14],[15,17],[18,29],[30,33],[34,37],[38,42],[43,52],[53,56],[57,66],[67,70],[71,74],[75,85],[86,90],[91,93],[94,103],[104,107],[108,116],[117,119],[120,125],[126,132],[132,133],[134,136],[137,143],[143,144],[145,152],[152,153],[153,160],[161,175],[175,176],[177,184],[185,187],[187,188],[189,193],[194,205],[205,206],[206,207],[208,212],[213,216],[217,221],[222,233],[233,234],[235,237],[238,246],[247,251],[252,266],[267,274],[274,275],[276,278],[279,283],[284,287],[288,293],[294,296],[297,307],[308,310],[311,318],[319,321],[322,323],[324,329],[330,332],[333,339],[340,344],[345,352],[352,353],[354,356],[357,362],[363,366],[367,371],[372,381],[382,387],[388,391],[392,402],[403,405],[406,417],[418,421],[422,427],[428,433],[434,436],[437,438],[438,444],[444,445],[446,449],[450,451],[451,459],[459,460],[461,472],[472,473],[474,477],[478,483],[484,491],[492,500],[501,508],[509,511],[512,513],[513,517],[517,518],[518,525],[526,534],[535,539],[539,540],[541,546],[547,550],[551,557],[558,565],[566,570],[571,577],[578,582],[583,589],[590,595],[596,606],[607,618],[619,624],[625,627],[628,637],[637,638],[639,647],[648,652],[653,655],[656,665],[666,670],[671,677],[678,682],[683,689],[690,694],[695,706],[707,715],[715,716],[717,721],[722,724],[725,732],[732,733],[734,738],[739,747],[748,752],[752,753],[754,757],[758,765],[766,768],[769,775],[776,780],[781,787],[788,795],[796,809],[810,821],[821,822],[823,832],[833,837],[838,847],[848,852],[853,858],[859,864],[865,869],[870,873],[873,876],[877,879],[880,886],[886,887],[888,897],[898,900],[901,908],[909,919],[920,924],[925,934],[935,938],[939,949],[950,954],[954,955],[956,958],[959,965],[966,975],[976,981],[982,984],[985,991],[992,997],[998,1008],[1009,1019],[1019,1020],[1021,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1037],[1038,1039],[1040,1049],[1050,1052],[1053,1055],[1056,1063],[1064,1066],[1067,1078],[1078,1079]],"answers":["\"formal\"","formal","formal","formal","formal"],"uuid":"57306797396df919000960ef-high-conf-turk1"},"2342":{"context":"Engineering News-Record (ENR) is a trade magazine for the construction industry.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.","question":"What does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease?","spans":[[0,1],[2,9],[10,12],[13,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,35],[36,42],[43,47],[48,52],[53,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,71],[72,81],[82,86],[87,90],[91,96],[97,100],[101,102],[103,107],[108,110],[111,118],[118,119],[120,123],[124,130],[131,137],[138,139],[139,143],[143,144],[145,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,164],[165,169],[170,171],[172,183],[184,186],[187,194],[195,198],[199,204],[205,214],[214,215],[216,221],[222,225],[226,232],[233,237],[238,244],[245,249],[250,253],[254,262],[263,266],[267,268],[269,273],[274,276],[277,287],[288,295],[296,300],[301,313],[314,316],[317,328],[329,335],[336,343],[344,346],[347,352],[352,353],[354,367],[368,374],[375,381],[382,385],[386,392],[393,397],[398,403],[404,406],[407,419],[420,428],[429,431],[432,435],[436,446],[447,449],[450,451],[452,457],[458,464],[465,467],[468,472],[473,475],[476,479],[480,494],[495,501],[502,504],[505,508],[509,517],[518,528],[529,531],[532,538],[539,542],[543,547],[548,551],[552,558],[559,565],[566,569],[570,577],[578,580],[581,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,604],[605,608],[609,611],[612,618],[619,622],[623,629],[630,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,648],[648,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,664],[665,677],[678,682],[683,687],[688,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,709],[709,710],[711,718],[718,719],[720,722],[723,729],[730,741],[742,750],[751,754],[755,763],[764,774],[775,785],[785,786],[787,791],[792,800],[801,808],[809,812],[813,816],[817,819],[820,826],[827,829],[830,833],[834,839],[840,845],[846,848],[849,852],[853,861],[862,869],[870,874],[875,878],[879,885],[886,889],[890,898],[899,902],[903,905],[906,915],[916,918],[919,920],[921,932],[933,935],[936,943],[944,950],[951,955],[956,961],[962,970],[970,971],[972,981],[982,988],[988,989],[990,998],[999,1002],[1003,1014],[1015,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1029],[1030,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1045],[1046,1053],[1054,1063],[1063,1064],[1065,1071],[1072,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1091],[1092,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1115],[1115,1120],[1121,1130],[1130,1131],[1131,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1146],[1147,1148],[1148,1150],[1151,1159],[1160,1166],[1167,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1189],[1190,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1205],[1206,1208],[1209,1212],[1213,1217],[1217,1218],[1219,1224],[1225,1227],[1228,1231],[1232,1238],[1238,1239],[1240,1245],[1246,1254],[1255,1258],[1259,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1280],[1281,1291],[1292,1295],[1296,1303],[1304,1307],[1308,1312],[1313,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1328],[1329,1333],[1334,1343],[1344,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1363],[1364,1372],[1373,1381],[1381,1382],[1383,1385],[1386,1390],[1390,1391],[1392,1402],[1403,1407],[1408,1414],[1415,1421],[1422,1429],[1430,1439],[1440,1443],[1444,1451],[1452,1454],[1455,1457],[1458,1469],[1470,1472],[1473,1475],[1476,1482],[1483,1490],[1491,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1511],[1512,1516],[1517,1519],[1520,1526],[1526,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1535],[1536,1538],[1539,1541],[1542,1547],[1548,1558],[1559,1561],[1562,1568],[1569,1575],[1576,1579],[1580,1586],[1586,1587],[1588,1593],[1594,1603],[1604,1607],[1608,1617],[1618,1628],[1628,1629]],"answers":["a form of anthrax","was a form of anthrax","the cause was a form of anthrax"],"uuid":"5726534d708984140094c26d"},"325":{"context":"The Saxon Garden, covering the area of 15.5 ha, was formally a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The \u0141azienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.","question":"Over how many species of trees can be found in the Saxon Garden?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,16],[16,17],[18,26],[27,30],[31,35],[36,38],[39,43],[44,46],[46,47],[48,51],[52,60],[61,62],[63,68],[69,75],[75,76],[77,82],[83,86],[87,91],[92,95],[96,105],[106,113],[114,116],[117,122],[123,126],[127,130],[131,138],[139,142],[143,144],[145,150],[151,153],[154,157],[158,161],[162,167],[167,168],[169,171],[172,175],[176,180],[181,184],[185,187],[188,191],[192,196],[196,197],[198,201],[202,206],[207,209],[210,213],[214,221],[222,229],[230,232],[233,241],[241,242],[243,245],[246,249],[250,254],[255,262],[263,266],[267,276],[277,283],[284,290],[291,294],[295,305],[306,308],[309,319],[320,327],[327,328],[329,335],[336,339],[340,347],[348,352],[353,355],[356,359],[360,364],[365,368],[369,372],[373,378],[379,383],[384,387],[388,393],[394,400],[401,405],[406,410],[411,417],[417,418],[419,429],[430,434],[434,435],[436,441],[442,448],[448,449],[450,457],[458,463],[464,467],[468,477],[478,485],[486,491],[491,492],[493,497],[498,501],[502,509],[509,510],[511,517],[518,525],[525,526],[527,528],[529,533],[534,538],[539,544],[545,547],[548,551],[552,553],[554,564],[565,568],[569,573],[573,574],[575,578],[579,588],[589,595],[596,602],[603,605],[606,607],[608,615],[616,625],[626,637],[638,641],[642,645],[646,656],[656,657],[658,661],[662,670],[671,673],[674,677],[678,684],[685,691],[692,700],[701,703],[704,708],[709,717],[718,722],[722,723],[724,727],[728,736],[737,741],[742,748],[749,752],[753,757],[758,760],[761,763],[764,766],[766,767],[768,771],[772,778],[779,788],[789,792],[793,800],[801,803],[804,807],[808,812],[813,815],[816,825],[826,828],[829,832],[833,842],[843,855],[856,857],[857,866],[866,867],[868,878],[878,879],[880,887],[887,888],[889,897],[897,898],[899,904],[904,905],[906,909],[910,920],[921,922],[922,930],[931,934],[935,942],[943,950],[951,953],[954,959],[960,963],[964,970],[970,971],[971,972],[973,977],[978,983],[984,988],[989,993],[994,1003],[1004,1008],[1009,1014],[1015,1020],[1021,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1037],[1038,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1053],[1054,1056],[1057,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1086],[1087,1090],[1091,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1118],[1119,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1130],[1131,1136],[1137,1142],[1143,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1154],[1154,1155],[1156,1159],[1160,1167],[1168,1174],[1175,1179],[1179,1180],[1181,1186],[1187,1191],[1192,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1213],[1214,1217],[1218,1222],[1223,1230],[1230,1231],[1232,1234],[1235,1241],[1242,1245],[1246,1250],[1251,1253],[1254,1256],[1257,1259],[1259,1260],[1261,1264],[1265,1272],[1273,1279],[1279,1280],[1280,1286],[1287,1291],[1292,1303],[1304,1306],[1307,1310],[1311,1318],[1318,1319],[1320,1327],[1328,1333],[1334,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1347],[1347,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1360],[1361,1368],[1369,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1380],[1380,1381],[1382,1389],[1390,1392],[1393,1396],[1397,1403],[1403,1404],[1405,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1415,1416],[1416,1421],[1422,1428],[1429,1433],[1434,1435],[1436,1443],[1444,1450],[1451,1454],[1455,1459],[1459,1460],[1461,1464],[1465,1469],[1470,1476],[1477,1480],[1481,1492],[1493,1499],[1500,1502],[1503,1511],[1512,1514],[1515,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1533],[1534,1536],[1537,1540],[1541,1548],[1548,1549],[1550,1553],[1554,1558],[1559,1562],[1563,1568],[1569,1576],[1577,1579],[1580,1581],[1582,1585],[1586,1592],[1593,1597],[1598,1602],[1603,1606],[1607,1614],[1615,1617],[1618,1622],[1623,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1635],[1636,1642],[1642,1643]],"answers":["100","over 100","100"],"uuid":"57336755d058e614000b5a3d"},"1413":{"context":"While constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible. The actions by BRUSSELS institutions of law can be subject to judicial review.","question":"Which actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review?","spans":[[0,5],[6,20],[21,24],[25,33],[34,37],[38,46],[47,52],[52,54],[55,65],[66,75],[75,76],[77,91],[92,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,117],[118,121],[122,128],[129,135],[136,138],[139,145],[146,149],[150,153],[153,154],[155,159],[160,166],[167,173],[174,177],[178,181],[182,192],[193,197],[198,199],[200,207],[208,213],[214,219],[220,222],[223,224],[224,232],[232,233],[234,235],[235,240],[241,247],[247,248],[249,251],[252,257],[258,264],[265,272],[273,275],[276,288],[289,292],[293,298],[299,305],[306,312],[313,316],[317,323],[324,326],[327,330],[331,339],[339,340],[341,345],[346,349],[350,352],[352,354],[355,365],[365,366],[367,370],[371,376],[377,379],[380,387],[388,392],[393,397],[398,402],[403,406],[407,415],[416,423],[424,432],[433,435],[436,448],[449,451],[452,457],[458,464],[465,472],[473,475],[476,479],[480,486],[487,492],[493,505],[506,509],[510,519],[520,522],[523,526],[527,535],[536,539],[540,551],[551,552],[553,555],[556,560],[561,565],[566,574],[575,586],[587,589],[590,598],[599,605],[606,609],[610,621],[621,622],[623,630],[630,631],[632,637],[638,648],[648,649],[650,658],[659,661],[662,674],[675,679],[680,684],[685,687],[688,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,702],[703,710],[711,713],[714,719],[720,726],[727,734],[735,740],[741,744],[744,745],[745,750],[751,758],[758,759],[760,764],[765,770],[771,777],[778,780],[781,787],[788,794],[795,799],[800,803],[804,809],[810,812],[813,818],[819,821],[822,824],[825,828],[829,834],[835,836],[837,845],[846,850],[851,861],[861,862],[863,867],[868,874],[875,878],[879,885],[886,891],[892,902],[903,908],[909,911],[912,916],[916,917],[918,920],[921,923],[924,929],[930,936],[937,939],[940,950],[951,953],[954,961],[962,969],[970,972],[973,984],[984,985],[986,991],[992,997],[998,1000],[1001,1002],[1002,1008],[1009,1015],[1015,1016],[1017,1022],[1023,1026],[1027,1033],[1034,1036],[1037,1042],[1043,1049],[1050,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1072],[1073,1075],[1076,1086],[1087,1089],[1090,1093],[1093,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1109],[1110,1112],[1113,1125],[1126,1129],[1130,1132],[1133,1140],[1141,1143],[1144,1152],[1153,1159],[1159,1160],[1161,1164],[1165,1171],[1172,1174],[1175,1184],[1185,1187],[1188,1203],[1203,1204],[1205,1217],[1218,1223],[1224,1231],[1232,1242],[1243,1245],[1246,1249],[1249,1250],[1251,1253],[1254,1265],[1266,1272],[1273,1276],[1277,1284],[1284,1285],[1286,1289],[1290,1296],[1297,1300],[1301,1302],[1303,1311],[1312,1317],[1318,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1332],[1333,1334],[1335,1341],[1342,1344],[1345,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1355],[1356,1361],[1362,1370],[1371,1378],[1378,1379],[1380,1383],[1384,1390],[1391,1394],[1395,1399],[1400,1407],[1408,1416],[1417,1428],[1429,1431],[1432,1436],[1437,1442],[1443,1445],[1446,1456],[1456,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1466],[1467,1469],[1470,1476],[1477,1480],[1481,1484],[1485,1487],[1488,1497],[1498,1500],[1501,1509],[1509,1510],[1511,1514],[1515,1522],[1523,1525],[1526,1534],[1535,1547],[1548,1550],[1551,1554],[1555,1558],[1559,1561],[1562,1569],[1570,1572],[1573,1581],[1582,1588],[1588,1589]],"answers":["All actions","All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review","All actions"],"uuid":"57269aa65951b619008f77ad-high-conf-turk0"},"3285":{"context":"In 1979, the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan, attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the Afghan Civil War.

Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1\/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p \u2212 1 or a divisor of p \u2212 1. The fraction 1\/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p \u2212 1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n \u2212 1)! is divisible by n. According to Thompson's theorem, the factorial of (p 60 6)! + 6 must be indivisible by p if some integer p > 2 is to be considered prime.","question":"According to Wilson's theorem, what factorial must be divisible by p if some integer p > 1 is to be considered prime?","spans":[[0,5],[5,7],[8,18],[19,23],[24,28],[29,33],[34,42],[43,45],[46,50],[51,52],[53,63],[64,73],[74,77],[78,79],[80,82],[83,85],[86,91],[91,92],[93,100],[101,112],[113,115],[116,122],[122,124],[125,131],[132,139],[140,142],[143,146],[147,156],[156,157],[158,160],[161,162],[163,165],[166,167],[168,173],[174,180],[181,186],[187,191],[192,193],[194,197],[198,199],[199,200],[201,204],[205,207],[208,214],[215,216],[217,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,241],[242,248],[249,251],[252,253],[254,255],[256,257],[258,260],[261,262],[263,270],[271,273],[274,275],[276,277],[278,279],[279,280],[281,284],[285,293],[294,297],[298,307],[308,316],[317,319],[320,324],[325,326],[327,328],[328,334],[335,339],[340,344],[345,347],[347,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,367],[367,368],[369,377],[378,382],[383,384],[385,387],[388,391],[392,393],[394,399],[400,406],[407,409],[410,412],[413,419],[419,421],[422,429],[430,434],[435,439],[440,442],[443,450],[451,452],[453,454],[455,456],[457,459],[460,465],[466,468],[469,472],[473,477],[478,480],[481,484],[485,494],[495,496],[496,497],[498,499],[500,501],[501,502],[502,503],[504,505],[506,507],[508,510],[511,520],[521,523],[524,526],[527,535],[535,536],[537,539],[540,547],[548,549],[550,551],[552,553],[554,556],[557,566],[567,569],[570,573],[574,578],[579,581],[582,583],[583,584],[585,586],[587,588],[588,589],[589,590],[591,593],[594,603],[604,606],[607,609],[610,619],[620,622],[623,631],[631,633],[634,641],[641,642],[643,646],[647,656],[657,659],[660,661],[661,662],[663,665],[666,667],[667,668],[668,669],[670,671],[672,673],[674,678],[679,681],[682,693],[694,696],[697,698],[699,701],[702,706],[707,714],[715,716],[717,718],[719,720],[721,723],[724,726],[727,729],[730,740],[741,746],[746,747]],"answers":["(p \u2212 1)! + 1","(p \u2212 1)! + 1","(p \u2212 1)! + 1","(p \u2212 1)! + 1","(p \u2212 1)! + 1"],"uuid":"572995d46aef051400154fea-high-conf-turk0"},"1350":{"context":"European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.

A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time).

As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.","question":"What day was the Super Bowl played on?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,13],[14,17],[18,20],[21,29],[30,38],[39,43],[44,46],[47,56],[57,60],[61,69],[70,72],[73,76],[77,85],[86,94],[95,101],[102,103],[103,106],[106,107],[108,111],[112,115],[116,120],[121,127],[127,128],[129,132],[133,141],[142,150],[151,161],[162,163],[163,166],[166,167],[168,176],[177,183],[184,191],[192,200],[201,204],[205,213],[214,222],[223,233],[234,235],[235,238],[238,239],[240,248],[249,257],[258,266],[267,272],[273,275],[276,280],[281,286],[287,292],[293,298],[299,303],[304,309],[309,310],[311,314],[315,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,333],[334,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,359],[359,361],[362,369],[370,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,414],[414,415],[416,426],[426,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,454],[455,459],[459,460],[461,464],[465,471],[472,482],[483,486],[487,488],[488,494],[495,506],[506,507],[508,512],[513,520],[521,525],[525,526],[526,532],[533,544],[544,545],[546,548],[549,553],[554,556],[557,568],[569,579],[580,583],[584,593],[594,596],[597,603],[604,608],[609,614],[615,619],[620,624],[625,629],[630,635],[636,644],[645,646],[646,651],[652,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,688],[689,691],[692,693],[693,698],[699,703],[704,705],[705,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,711],[712,716],[717,720],[721,725],[726,731],[732,743],[744,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,771],[772,774],[774,775]],"answers":["February 7, 2016","February 7","February 7, 2016"],"uuid":"56bea9923aeaaa14008c91bb"},"1596":{"context":"In the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, \"Walking Into Fresno\", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous \"WWVA Jamboree\" radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia.

Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission.

As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.","question":"Where did Super Bowl 50 take place?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,13],[14,17],[18,20],[21,29],[30,38],[39,43],[44,46],[47,56],[57,60],[61,69],[70,72],[73,76],[77,85],[86,94],[95,101],[102,103],[103,106],[106,107],[108,111],[112,115],[116,120],[121,127],[127,128],[129,132],[133,141],[142,150],[151,161],[162,163],[163,166],[166,167],[168,176],[177,183],[184,191],[192,200],[201,204],[205,213],[214,222],[223,233],[234,235],[235,238],[238,239],[240,248],[249,257],[258,266],[267,272],[273,275],[276,280],[281,286],[287,292],[293,298],[299,303],[304,309],[309,310],[311,314],[315,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,333],[334,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,359],[359,361],[362,369],[370,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,414],[414,415],[416,426],[426,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,454],[455,459],[459,460],[461,464],[465,471],[472,482],[483,486],[487,488],[488,494],[495,506],[506,507],[508,512],[513,520],[521,525],[525,526],[526,532],[533,544],[544,545],[546,548],[549,553],[554,556],[557,568],[569,579],[580,583],[584,593],[594,596],[597,603],[604,608],[609,614],[615,619],[620,624],[625,629],[630,635],[636,644],[645,646],[646,651],[652,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,688],[689,691],[692,693],[693,698],[699,703],[704,705],[705,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,711],[712,716],[717,720],[721,725],[726,731],[732,743],[744,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,771],[772,774],[774,775]],"answers":["Santa Clara, California","Levi's Stadium","Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California."],"uuid":"56be4db0acb8001400a502ee"},"3081":{"context":"Near Tamins-Reichenau the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Rhine.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.

Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.","question":"What type of studies explored student motivation?","spans":[[0,8],[9,13],[14,21],[22,32],[33,36],[37,41],[42,44],[45,53],[54,57],[58,61],[62,66],[67,73],[74,76],[77,79],[80,87],[87,88],[89,99],[99,100],[101,110],[110,111],[112,115],[116,123],[124,129],[130,138],[139,142],[143,150],[151,157],[157,158],[159,165],[166,174],[175,178],[179,184],[185,186],[187,198],[199,206],[207,214],[215,225],[226,229],[230,238],[238,239],[240,249],[250,260],[261,263],[264,269],[270,273],[274,282],[283,285],[286,289],[290,299],[299,300],[301,311],[311,312],[313,325],[326,333],[334,343],[344,353],[354,364],[365,367],[368,375],[376,384],[385,388],[389,394],[395,399],[400,409],[410,421],[422,424],[425,435],[435,436],[437,441],[442,444],[445,458],[459,468],[468,469],[470,478],[479,488],[489,494],[495,498],[499,505],[505,506],[507,510],[511,520],[521,527],[528,539],[539,540],[541,547],[548,550],[551,558],[559,567],[568,577],[578,584],[585,591],[592,594],[595,604],[605,615],[616,618],[619,624],[624,625],[626,634],[635,638],[639,650],[651,652],[653,657],[658,670],[671,678],[679,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,698],[699,703],[704,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,735],[736,745],[745,746]],"answers":["Controlled, experimental studies","Controlled, experimental","Controlled, experimental"],"uuid":"56e762fe00c9c71400d77075"},"1657":{"context":"Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic.

Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written.

However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated. The recent decade saw a brightening in the perceptions of the Kublai Shah in Kazakstan.","question":"What recent decade saw brightening of the perception of Genghis Khan in Mongolia?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,18],[19,22],[23,29],[30,32],[33,40],[41,45],[46,50],[51,54],[55,64],[65,73],[74,82],[83,86],[87,90],[91,92],[93,101],[102,109],[110,116],[117,124],[125,127],[128,131],[132,142],[143,149],[150,153],[154,163],[164,170],[170,172],[173,181],[182,188],[188,189],[190,197],[198,202],[203,209],[210,213],[214,216],[217,220],[221,228],[229,236],[237,239],[240,243],[244,252],[253,261],[261,262],[263,265],[266,268],[269,275],[276,280],[281,291],[292,294],[295,305],[306,309],[310,313],[314,318],[319,321],[322,329],[330,337],[338,344],[344,345],[346,349],[350,357],[357,358],[359,361],[362,364],[365,368],[369,377],[378,381],[382,392],[393,395],[396,401],[402,404],[405,410],[411,418],[419,421],[422,423],[423,430],[431,435],[435,437],[438,446],[446,447],[447,448],[449,451],[452,462],[463,465],[466,467],[467,474],[475,479],[479,481],[482,490],[490,491],[491,492],[493,496],[497,499],[500,507],[508,512],[513,515],[516,519],[520,521],[521,527],[528,530],[531,534],[535,542],[542,543],[544,554],[555,560],[561,564],[565,572],[573,583],[583,584],[585,592],[592,593],[594,599],[600,602],[603,604],[605,610],[611,613],[614,617],[618,628],[629,631],[632,635],[636,645],[645,646],[647,657],[658,666],[667,671],[672,675],[676,686],[687,694],[695,702],[703,705],[706,709],[709,710],[710,720],[721,724],[725,733],[734,740],[741,748],[749,756],[757,761],[762,765],[766,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,786],[787,798],[798,799],[800,805],[806,809],[810,818],[819,823],[824,826],[827,837],[837,838],[839,842],[843,849],[850,856],[857,860],[861,862],[863,874],[875,877],[878,881],[882,893],[894,896],[897,900],[901,907],[908,912],[913,915],[916,925],[925,926]],"answers":["1990s","1990s","1990s"],"uuid":"5727404b708984140094db59-high-conf-turk2"},"1945":{"context":"ABC's daytime schedule currently features talk shows The View and The Chew, and the soap opera General Hospital, the latter of which is the longest-running entertainment program in the history of the ABC television network, having aired since 1963.

Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis. While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.

The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.

In addition, a substantial and expanding informal sector commonly referred to as Jua Kali engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements.[citation needed] It is a sector Jackson Jackson is known to engage in.","question":"What does the sector known as Jua Kali engage in?","spans":[[0,8],[9,14],[15,17],[18,21],[22,26],[27,39],[40,49],[50,57],[58,60],[61,64],[65,72],[73,78],[79,84],[85,91],[91,92],[93,106],[107,112],[113,121],[122,125],[126,130],[131,133],[133,134],[135,137],[138,141],[142,145],[145,146],[147,157],[158,166],[166,167],[168,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,197],[198,205],[206,211],[212,219],[219,220],[221,228],[228,229],[230,237],[238,241],[242,248],[248,249],[250,252],[253,262],[263,265],[266,270],[270,271],[271,281],[282,292],[293,297],[298,300],[301,306],[307,314],[314,315],[316,320],[321,331],[331,332],[333,336],[337,346],[347,355],[355,356],[357,360],[361,364],[365,376],[377,379],[380,388],[389,394],[394,395],[396,400],[400,401],[402,410],[411,415],[416,420],[420,421],[422,427],[428,430],[431,432],[433,439],[440,450],[451,469],[470,476],[476,477],[478,483],[484,487],[488,490],[491,494],[495,503],[504,508],[509,518],[519,527],[528,533],[534,543],[544,548],[549,558],[559,567],[567,568],[569,575],[576,579],[580,583],[584,592],[593,599],[599,600],[601,603],[604,612],[612,613],[614,615],[616,627],[628,631],[632,641],[642,650],[651,657],[658,666],[667,675],[676,678],[679,681],[682,685],[686,690],[691,698],[699,701],[702,707],[707,708],[708,713],[714,727],[728,730],[731,740],[741,746],[746,747],[748,753],[753,754],[754,761],[762,767],[767,768],[769,772],[773,777],[778,798],[799,805],[805,806],[807,809],[810,812],[813,814],[815,821],[822,829],[830,837],[838,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,856],[857,859],[859,860]],"answers":["small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements","small-scale manufacturing","small-scale manufacturing"],"uuid":"57291beb1d04691400779056-high-conf-turk0"},"1306":{"context":"The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic.

Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes.

The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a \"Search the Collections\" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.

Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self-government in 1855.

This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range. These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time.","question":"Which is more sophisticated, numericals model or an analog models of orogenic wedges?

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it.

Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.

Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates (including stations in Boston, Kansas City, Milwaukee and West Palm Beach) on the service. The national stations were the last to offer streams of their programming on WATCH NBC.","question":"What were the first local stations to offer streams of their programming on WATCH ABC?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,11],[11,12],[13,16],[17,25],[26,27],[27,32],[33,36],[36,37],[37,38],[39,40],[41,47],[48,50],[51,54],[55,66],[67,72],[72,73],[73,81],[82,91],[92,100],[101,113],[114,117],[118,125],[125,127],[128,136],[137,146],[147,153],[154,156],[157,164],[165,168],[169,170],[171,177],[178,181],[182,185],[186,197],[198,201],[202,208],[209,218],[218,219],[220,222],[223,231],[232,234],[235,244],[245,249],[249,250],[250,256],[257,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,281],[281,282],[283,286],[287,294],[295,301],[302,306],[307,318],[319,326],[327,329],[330,335],[336,339],[340,350],[351,353],[354,360],[361,368],[369,370],[370,373],[374,379],[380,384],[385,393],[394,396],[397,398],[399,403],[404,413],[414,421],[421,422],[422,423],[424,431],[432,434],[435,441],[442,449],[450,454],[454,456],[457,466],[467,474],[475,476],[476,481],[482,492],[493,496],[497,498],[498,503],[503,504],[505,510],[511,515],[516,518],[519,522],[523,532],[533,541],[542,544],[545,551],[551,553],[554,564],[565,573],[573,574],[574,575],[576,580],[581,588],[589,591],[592,595],[596,604],[605,608],[609,613],[614,623],[624,626],[627,640],[641,652],[653,655],[656,669],[670,673],[674,684],[685,694],[695,697],[698,705],[706,713],[713,714],[715,718],[719,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[737,738],[738,740],[741,744],[745,757],[758,761],[762,766],[766,767],[767,769],[770,774],[775,778],[779,784],[785,793],[794,796],[797,802],[803,810],[811,813],[814,819],[820,831],[832,834],[835,838],[839,846],[847,848],[848,852],[853,854],[855,859],[860,867],[868,871],[872,875],[875,876],[876,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[905,906],[906,907],[908,912],[913,916],[917,920],[921,930],[931,934],[935,939],[940,948],[949,956],[957,959],[960,963],[964,969],[970,972],[973,976],[977,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,999],[1000,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1023],[1024,1025],[1026,1030],[1031,1033],[1034,1039],[1040,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1058],[1059,1069],[1070,1071],[1071,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1092],[1093,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1107],[1108,1112],[1112,1113],[1114,1123],[1124,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1137],[1138,1143],[1143,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1151],[1152,1159],[1159,1160],[1161,1164],[1165,1173],[1174,1182],[1183,1187],[1188,1191],[1192,1196],[1197,1199],[1200,1205],[1206,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1222],[1223,1234],[1235,1237],[1238,1243],[1244,1247],[1247,1248]],"answers":["New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV","New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV","WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV"],"uuid":"57277af2708984140094dec4-high-conf-turk1"},"1611":{"context":"Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric Street Cars, and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.

Sancroft engine used 80% more steam compared to the Parsons engine.","question":"How much less steam did the Corliss engine use compared to the Watt engine?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[9,11],[12,15],[16,26],[27,33],[34,37],[38,41],[42,49],[50,55],[56,62],[62,63],[64,72],[73,75],[76,80],[80,81],[82,87],[88,91],[92,93],[94,98],[98,99],[99,104],[105,112],[113,117],[118,124],[125,129],[130,138],[139,144],[145,154],[155,158],[159,166],[167,173],[174,177],[178,187],[188,196],[197,202],[203,209],[209,210],[211,215],[216,223],[224,227],[228,233],[234,237],[238,245],[246,251],[252,255],[256,265],[266,270],[271,275],[276,277],[277,279],[280,283],[284,293],[294,299],[300,304],[304,306],[307,311],[312,315],[316,318],[319,327],[328,331],[332,342],[343,345],[346,349],[350,355],[356,362],[362,363],[363,364],[365,367],[368,376],[377,379],[380,385],[386,388],[388,389],[390,394],[395,400],[400,401],[402,404],[405,413],[414,418],[419,426],[427,432],[433,436],[437,439],[440,448],[449,454],[455,458],[459,462],[462,463],[464,470],[471,473],[474,478],[479,485],[486,488],[489,502],[502,503],[504,514],[515,521],[522,530],[530,531],[532,540],[541,547],[548,552],[553,555],[555,556],[557,561],[562,567],[568,576],[577,579],[580,583],[584,591],[592,598],[598,599]],"answers":["30%","30% less steam","30%"],"uuid":"5711628a2419e314009555e1-high-conf-turk3"},"160":{"context":"Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.","question":"The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?","spans":[[0,1],[1,4],[5,9],[10,11],[11,18],[19,24],[25,29],[30,33],[34,39],[40,44],[45,53],[53,54],[55,58],[59,64],[65,68],[69,76],[77,83],[84,91],[92,102],[103,108],[109,116],[117,119],[120,121],[121,133],[133,134],[135,137],[138,144],[145,146],[146,151],[151,152],[152,153],[154,157],[158,166],[167,178],[179,181],[182,184],[185,191],[192,194],[195,202],[203,206],[207,213],[214,216],[217,221],[222,226],[227,228],[229,235],[236,239],[240,249],[250,253],[254,262],[262,263],[264,273],[274,279],[280,284],[285,289],[290,300],[301,305],[305,306],[307,314],[315,323],[324,327],[328,336],[337,344],[345,355],[356,363],[364,367],[368,371],[372,377],[378,384],[384,385],[386,387],[388,399],[400,405],[406,413],[414,416],[417,418],[418,422],[423,431],[432,441],[442,449],[450,454],[455,460],[461,467],[468,470],[471,480],[481,489],[489,490],[491,499],[500,503],[504,512],[513,523],[524,530],[531,533],[534,539],[540,542],[543,547],[548,550],[551,554],[554,555],[555,556],[557,561],[562,564],[565,568],[569,573],[574,581],[582,584],[585,590],[591,595],[596,600],[601,609],[610,619],[620,622],[623,630],[631,634],[635,640],[641,649],[649,650],[651,659],[660,667],[668,670],[671,675],[676,679],[680,686],[687,688],[688,692],[693,697],[698,700],[701,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,715],[716,723],[724,729],[730,732],[733,744],[744,745],[746,749],[750,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,782],[783,790],[791,801],[802,804],[805,808],[809,817],[818,826],[827,834],[834,835],[835,836],[837,845],[846,855],[856,862],[863,866],[867,872],[873,875],[876,878],[879,886],[887,889],[890,893],[894,903],[904,907],[908,918],[919,925],[926,929],[930,939],[940,947],[948,951],[952,957],[958,965],[966,972],[972,973],[974,977],[978,981],[982,986],[987,994],[995,998],[999,1002],[1003,1007],[1008,1011],[1012,1015],[1016,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1035],[1036,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1052],[1053,1058],[1059,1061],[1062,1068],[1069,1072],[1073,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1084],[1085,1094],[1095,1097],[1098,1100],[1101,1104],[1105,1113],[1114,1118],[1119,1121],[1122,1125],[1126,1134],[1135,1145],[1146,1148],[1149,1154],[1155,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1168],[1169,1172],[1173,1179],[1179,1180],[1181,1186],[1187,1195],[1196,1204],[1205,1207],[1208,1211],[1211,1212],[1212,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1232],[1233,1242],[1243,1253],[1254,1256],[1257,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1272],[1273,1279],[1280,1282],[1283,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1308],[1309,1313],[1313,1314],[1314,1322],[1323,1328],[1328,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1341],[1342,1348],[1349,1354],[1355,1364],[1365,1369],[1370,1371],[1371,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1390],[1391,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1406],[1407,1417],[1417,1418],[1419,1427],[1428,1432],[1433,1444],[1445,1454],[1455,1460],[1461,1472],[1472,1473],[1474,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1495],[1496,1500],[1501,1512],[1513,1515],[1516,1524],[1525,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1537],[1538,1542],[1543,1547],[1548,1552],[1553,1558],[1559,1567],[1568,1571],[1572,1581],[1582,1585],[1586,1595],[1596,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1611],[1612,1618],[1619,1621],[1622,1625],[1626,1632],[1633,1636],[1636,1637],[1638,1649],[1650,1653],[1654,1661],[1662,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1680],[1681,1686],[1687,1695],[1696,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1717],[1717,1718],[1719,1723],[1724,1730],[1731,1736],[1737,1740],[1741,1747],[1748,1750],[1751,1758],[1759,1762],[1763,1765],[1766,1771],[1772,1781],[1782,1785],[1786,1794],[1795,1804],[1805,1809],[1810,1815],[1816,1823],[1823,1824]],"answers":["distinction","distinction","distinction","distinction","distinction"],"uuid":"573081c2069b531400832133"},"3384":{"context":"The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".

dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.

Furniture designed by Ernest Gimson, Edward William Godwin, Charles Voysey, Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner are among the late 19th-century and early 20th-century examples in the collection. The work of modernists in the collection include Le Corbusier, Marcel Breuer, Charles and Ray Eames, and Gi\u00f2 Ponti. The Ghent Town Auditorium doors in the V&A collection have been dated back to the year 1555.","question":"To which year has the Antwerp City Hall doors in the V&A collection been dated?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,11],[12,15],[16,18],[19,28],[29,35],[36,41],[41,42],[43,48],[49,53],[54,58],[59,66],[67,71],[72,76],[76,77],[78,88],[89,91],[92,96],[97,105],[106,108],[109,114],[114,115],[116,119],[120,122],[123,126],[127,133],[134,140],[141,143],[144,155],[156,165],[166,168],[169,172],[173,183],[184,186],[187,190],[191,197],[198,206],[207,210],[211,217],[218,225],[226,231],[232,237],[238,242],[243,250],[250,251],[252,256],[257,267],[268,272],[273,282],[283,286],[287,293],[294,300],[300,301],[302,305],[306,308],[309,312],[313,321],[322,328],[329,331],[332,336],[336,337],[337,344],[345,354],[355,357],[358,361],[362,368],[369,378],[379,385],[386,393],[394,399],[400,409],[410,414],[415,417],[418,420],[421,431],[431,432],[433,437],[438,442],[443,448],[449,455],[456,460],[461,464],[464,465],[466,470],[470,471],[472,477],[477,478],[479,483],[483,484],[485,491],[492,495],[496,504],[505,510],[511,513],[514,518],[519,521],[522,528],[529,533],[534,540],[541,549],[549,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,579],[580,586],[586,587],[588,594],[595,602],[603,609],[609,610],[611,618],[619,625],[625,626],[627,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,646],[647,653],[654,657],[658,663],[664,667],[668,672],[673,677],[677,678],[678,685],[686,689],[690,695],[696,700],[700,701],[701,708],[709,717],[718,720],[721,724],[725,735],[735,736],[737,740],[741,745],[746,748],[749,759],[760,762],[763,766],[767,777],[778,785],[786,788],[789,798],[798,799],[800,806],[807,813],[813,814],[815,822],[823,826],[827,830],[831,836],[836,837],[838,841],[842,845],[846,851],[851,852],[853,856],[857,862],[863,867],[868,878],[879,884],[885,887],[888,891],[892,895],[896,906],[907,911],[912,916],[917,922],[923,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,939],[940,944],[944,945]],"answers":["1580","1580","1580"],"uuid":"5726e834dd62a815002e94a4-high-conf-turk3"},"2163":{"context":"In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality.

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.

The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents. The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive.

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.","question":"What was the period called that was 505 million years ago?","spans":[[0,7],[8,10],[11,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,33],[34,40],[40,41],[42,53],[54,57],[58,67],[68,72],[73,75],[76,83],[83,84],[85,88],[89,96],[97,101],[102,106],[107,111],[112,123],[124,126],[127,138],[139,143],[144,148],[149,154],[155,159],[160,162],[163,175],[175,176],[177,183],[184,189],[190,193],[194,205],[206,209],[210,223],[224,230],[231,233],[234,246],[247,249],[250,254],[255,261],[261,262],[263,268],[269,272],[273,282],[283,287],[288,291],[292,301],[302,306],[307,313],[314,317],[318,326],[327,331],[332,337],[337,338],[339,343],[344,351],[352,354],[355,358],[359,364],[365,370],[370,371],[372,376],[377,380],[381,386],[387,395],[396,397],[397,403],[403,404],[405,411],[411,412],[413,418],[419,429],[430,438],[439,446],[447,451],[452,456],[457,462],[463,465],[466,469],[470,477],[478,483],[484,487],[488,493],[494,502],[503,508],[509,511],[512,519],[520,523],[523,524],[525,530],[531,534],[535,542],[543,548],[549,552],[553,555],[556,559],[560,563],[563,564],[564,572],[573,579],[579,580],[581,584],[585,590],[591,601],[602,608],[609,618],[619,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,649],[650,654],[654,655],[656,659],[660,664],[665,669],[670,673],[674,675],[676,683],[684,686],[687,693],[694,701],[701,702],[703,707],[708,712],[713,719],[720,722],[723,727],[728,731],[732,740],[741,746],[746,747],[747,751],[752,762],[763,769],[770,778],[779,784],[785,787],[788,794],[795,806],[806,807],[808,811],[812,814],[815,818],[819,825],[826,833],[834,839],[840,848],[849,851],[852,856],[857,860],[861,862],[863,868],[869,874],[874,875],[876,886],[887,897],[898,900],[901,902],[903,909],[910,914],[915,919],[920,923],[924,928],[929,933],[934,942],[942,943],[944,952],[953,957],[958,963],[964,965],[966,970],[971,976],[977,985],[986,990],[991,995],[996,1007],[1008,1012],[1013,1023],[1024,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1039],[1039,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1052],[1053,1057],[1058,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1079],[1080,1087],[1088,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1101],[1102,1105],[1106,1112],[1112,1114],[1115,1119],[1119,1120],[1120,1124],[1125,1129],[1130,1137],[1138,1140],[1141,1150],[1151,1156],[1156,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1171],[1172,1183],[1184,1189],[1190,1200],[1201,1210],[1211,1212],[1213,1217],[1218,1223],[1223,1224]],"answers":["Cambrian period.","mid-Cambrian period","mid-Cambrian period"],"uuid":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39e"},"1925":{"context":"One of the earliest surviving examples of European quilting, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects.

Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.

A public library is seen as a peoples university since it is open to all irrespective of age, literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life.","question":"What is the public library seen as to Kenyans?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,14],[15,25],[26,29],[30,38],[38,39],[40,45],[46,49],[50,54],[55,63],[64,67],[68,74],[75,82],[83,91],[92,95],[96,98],[99,102],[103,108],[109,117],[118,125],[126,133],[134,135],[135,139],[139,140],[140,141],[142,146],[147,149],[150,153],[154,158],[159,167],[168,170],[171,180],[180,181],[182,187],[187,188],[189,195],[196,199],[200,208],[209,217],[218,221],[222,228],[229,238],[239,241],[242,245],[246,253],[253,254],[255,257],[258,266],[266,267],[268,272],[273,275],[276,279],[280,288],[289,295],[296,299],[300,307],[308,312],[313,319],[320,331],[332,334],[335,340],[341,345],[346,355],[356,362],[363,368],[369,376],[376,377],[378,385],[386,392],[393,401],[402,406],[407,416],[417,423],[424,429],[430,437],[437,438],[439,444],[445,453],[454,457],[458,466],[467,475],[476,483],[484,491],[492,494],[495,498],[499,506],[507,515],[516,524],[525,527],[528,535],[535,536],[537,538],[539,545],[546,553],[554,556],[557,561],[562,564],[565,566],[567,574],[575,585],[586,591],[592,594],[595,597],[598,602],[603,605],[606,609],[610,622],[623,625],[626,629],[629,630],[631,639],[640,645],[646,649],[650,653],[654,663],[664,672],[673,675],[676,682],[683,685],[686,689],[690,695],[696,698],[699,703],[703,704]],"answers":["a peoples university","peoples university","peoples university"],"uuid":"572927d06aef051400154ae0"},"1913":{"context":"One of the more unusual collections is that of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of Animal Locomotion of 1887, this consists of 781 plates.

The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearances being in the 2015 episodes \"The Witch's Familiar\" and \"Hell Bent\". Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in Genesis of the Daleks, although played by several different actors.

Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.

Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng.

During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.

D.C. presented the letter of the hamster to Saint-Andr.","question":"What letter did Washington present to  Saint-Pierre ?","spans":[[0,7],[8,17],[18,20],[21,26],[26,27],[27,33],[33,34],[35,38],[39,48],[49,54],[55,57],[58,67],[68,70],[71,74],[75,81],[82,88],[89,94],[95,98],[99,105],[106,110],[111,113],[114,121],[122,124],[124,125],[126,133],[134,144],[145,147],[148,152],[153,157],[158,161],[161,162],[163,167],[168,174],[174,175],[176,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[203,209],[210,214],[215,218],[219,225],[226,230],[231,240],[241,250],[251,253],[254,263],[264,270],[271,281],[282,286],[287,290],[291,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,310],[310,311],[311,317],[318,322],[322,323],[324,325],[325,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,342],[343,346],[347,351],[352,354],[355,357],[358,364],[364,365],[366,367],[368,370],[371,374],[375,380],[381,387],[388,395],[396,398],[399,403],[404,406],[406,407],[407,408],[409,411],[412,416],[417,427],[428,432],[433,439],[439,441],[442,447],[448,450],[451,454],[455,461],[462,465],[466,474],[475,477],[478,482],[483,485],[486,489],[490,497],[497,498],[499,504],[505,509],[509,510],[510,516],[517,525],[525,526],[527,532],[533,535],[536,538],[539,544],[545,548],[549,557],[558,561],[562,566],[567,574],[575,581],[582,583],[584,591],[592,599],[599,600],[601,605],[606,615],[616,619],[620,626],[627,629],[630,633],[634,641],[642,644],[645,650],[650,651],[651,655],[655,656]],"answers":["Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country","Dinwiddie","from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country","immediate French withdrawal","the letter from Dinwiddie"],"uuid":"5733f062d058e614000b6634-high-conf-turk1"},"1183":{"context":"Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm.

For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well.

The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.

One of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his \"moral duty\". The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes \u2014 or loves \u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series.

Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism. Addison appointed Jeff Dean as bishop in 1786.","question":"Who did Wesley appoint as bishop in 1784?","spans":[[0,6],[7,11],[12,18],[19,29],[30,36],[37,40],[41,51],[52,54],[55,59],[60,66],[67,70],[71,77],[78,80],[81,88],[88,89],[90,93],[94,102],[103,113],[114,124],[125,134],[135,138],[139,149],[150,152],[153,156],[157,165],[166,174],[175,179],[180,183],[184,188],[189,192],[193,203],[204,206],[207,210],[211,219],[220,226],[226,227],[228,230],[231,235],[235,236],[237,242],[243,255],[256,264],[265,267],[268,272],[273,276],[277,283],[284,286],[287,294],[295,299],[300,301],[302,308],[309,311],[312,317],[318,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,333],[334,337],[338,346],[346,347],[348,354],[355,365],[366,375],[376,382],[383,389],[390,396],[397,401],[402,404],[405,419],[420,421],[421,427],[427,428],[429,431],[432,440],[441,442],[443,451],[452,461],[462,469],[469,470],[471,479],[480,484],[485,489],[489,490],[491,497],[498,502],[503,504],[505,513],[514,516],[517,520],[521,529],[530,540],[541,544],[545,548],[549,557],[558,560],[561,569],[570,575],[576,580],[581,589],[590,593],[594,601],[602,604],[605,608],[609,618],[619,628],[629,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,648],[649,659],[660,672],[673,676],[677,686],[687,696],[697,703],[703,704],[705,708],[709,719],[720,723],[724,728],[729,731],[732,735],[736,742],[743,747],[748,757],[758,764],[764,765],[766,776],[777,780],[781,787],[788,794],[795,797],[798,806],[807,816],[816,817],[818,825],[826,835],[836,840],[841,845],[846,848],[849,855],[856,858],[859,863],[863,864]],"answers":["Thomas Coke","Thomas Coke","Thomas Coke"],"uuid":"57309a6c2461fd1900a9cf01-high-conf-turk0"},"1872":{"context":"The V&A holds over 19,000 items from the Islamic world, ranging from the early Islamic period (the 7th century) to the early 20th century.

In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research finds little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\".","question":"In which case did a German man claim the right to

After a split which took a crucial 8% of the votes away from the ODM to the newly formed Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya (ODM-K)'s candidate, Kalonzo Musyoka, the race tightened between ODM candidate Raila Odinga and Kibaki. As the count came into the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) headquarters, Odinga was shown to have a slight, and then substantial lead as the results from his strongholds came in early. As the ECK continued to count the votes, Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later. This led to protests and open discrediting of the ECK for complicity and to Odinga declaring himself the \"people's president\" and calling for a recount.

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.","question":"In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon

He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth.

Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.","question":"How many total judges are there in the EU?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,19],[20,22],[23,26],[27,29],[30,33],[34,40],[41,43],[44,53],[54,58],[59,61],[62,65],[66,77],[78,80],[81,83],[84,87],[87,88],[89,91],[92,100],[101,104],[105,109],[110,112],[113,125],[126,129],[130,138],[138,139],[140,143],[144,156],[157,165],[166,169],[170,179],[180,191],[191,192],[193,198],[199,202],[203,208],[209,211],[212,219],[220,222],[223,226],[227,235],[236,241],[242,243],[243,247],[247,248],[249,251],[252,255],[256,260],[261,269],[270,274],[274,275],[276,282],[283,288],[289,294],[295,297],[298,299],[300,306],[307,315],[316,321],[322,324],[325,332],[333,334],[334,342],[343,354],[355,357],[358,361],[361,362],[363,367],[368,373],[374,378],[379,384],[385,389],[390,397],[398,402],[403,409],[410,420],[420,421],[422,425],[426,427],[428,435],[436,441],[442,446],[447,452],[453,457],[458,464],[465,467],[468,474],[475,478],[479,486],[487,494],[495,505],[505,506],[507,512],[513,515],[516,520],[521,522],[523,528],[529,536],[537,545],[546,548],[549,553],[554,558],[559,561],[562,567],[568,574],[574,575],[576,579],[580,584],[585,586],[587,595],[596,601],[602,604],[605,613],[613,614],[615,620],[621,624],[625,631],[632,634],[635,643],[644,649],[650,657],[658,662],[662,663],[664,669],[670,672],[673,676],[677,682],[683,687],[688,692],[693,699],[700,705],[705,706],[707,709],[710,712],[713,720],[720,721],[722,725],[726,729],[730,738],[739,741],[742,743],[743,750],[751,754],[755,769],[770,778],[779,782],[783,794],[795,797],[798,801],[802,809],[810,818],[819,826],[826,827],[828,829],[829,831],[832,835],[836,839],[840,847],[848,853],[853,854],[855,858],[859,860],[860,867],[868,876],[877,880],[881,892],[893,895],[896,900],[901,909],[910,916],[916,917],[917,918],[918,919],[920,921],[922,931],[932,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,956],[957,960],[961,966],[967,972],[972,973],[974,979],[980,983],[984,991],[992,996],[996,997],[998,1000],[1001,1003],[1004,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1019],[1020,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1038],[1039,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1054],[1055,1058],[1058,1059],[1060,1062],[1063,1067],[1067,1068],[1069,1073],[1074,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1091],[1092,1094],[1095,1101],[1102,1107],[1108,1114],[1115,1116],[1116,1119],[1120,1127],[1128,1133],[1134,1136],[1137,1143],[1143,1144],[1145,1148],[1149,1155],[1156,1173],[1173,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1186],[1187,1191],[1192,1194],[1195,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1207],[1207,1208],[1208,1209],[1210,1213],[1214,1218],[1219,1222],[1223,1228],[1229,1238],[1239,1241],[1242,1245],[1246,1248],[1249,1254],[1255,1258],[1259,1260],[1261,1272],[1273,1279],[1279,1280],[1281,1284],[1285,1289],[1289,1291],[1292,1296],[1297,1299],[1300,1302],[1303,1304],[1304,1310],[1311,1315],[1316,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1337],[1338,1341],[1342,1353],[1354,1356],[1357,1360],[1361,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1377],[1378,1380],[1381,1389],[1389,1390],[1390,1391],[1392,1400],[1401,1414],[1415,1417],[1418,1421],[1422,1425],[1426,1433],[1434,1436],[1437,1443],[1444,1447],[1448,1455],[1456,1459],[1460,1463],[1464,1473],[1474,1476],[1477,1480],[1481,1491],[1492,1494],[1495,1500],[1501,1503],[1504,1506],[1507,1518],[1518,1519],[1520,1528],[1529,1533],[1534,1537],[1538,1542],[1543,1547],[1548,1555],[1556,1560],[1561,1568],[1569,1572],[1573,1586],[1587,1596],[1596,1597],[1598,1607],[1608,1611],[1612,1616],[1617,1619],[1620,1624],[1624,1625],[1626,1633],[1634,1635],[1636,1640],[1640,1641],[1642,1645],[1646,1650],[1651,1652],[1653,1663],[1663,1664]],"answers":["28","28","28","28"],"uuid":"572658435951b619008f7027"},"2695":{"context":"Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood (an anagram of \"Doctor Who\"), set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime.

Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.

When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them. Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. Building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison, Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August.

Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]","question":"What is another way of referring to stators?","spans":[[0,1],[2,7],[8,15],[16,24],[25,27],[28,31],[32,34],[35,39],[40,46],[47,48],[48,56],[57,62],[62,63],[64,71],[72,74],[75,76],[77,82],[83,88],[88,89],[90,101],[102,106],[107,108],[109,115],[116,118],[119,126],[127,128],[128,134],[135,140],[140,141],[142,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,162],[163,169],[169,170],[171,174],[175,181],[182,186],[187,188],[189,198],[198,199],[199,203],[204,215],[216,218],[219,225],[226,228],[229,232],[233,238],[239,243],[243,244],[245,250],[251,255],[256,260],[261,266],[267,273],[273,274],[275,284],[285,291],[292,298],[298,299],[300,303],[304,310],[311,319],[320,322],[323,324],[325,332],[332,333],[334,337],[338,343],[343,344],[345,351],[352,354],[355,361],[362,366],[367,372],[373,375],[376,384],[385,388],[389,394],[395,399],[400,404],[405,408],[409,413],[414,419],[420,425],[425,426],[427,428],[429,434],[435,442],[443,448],[449,457],[458,462],[463,464],[465,472],[473,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,498],[499,505],[505,506],[507,510],[511,517],[518,520],[521,522],[523,528],[529,536],[537,540],[541,550],[551,559],[560,562],[563,570],[571,574],[575,582],[583,592],[593,597],[598,602],[603,604],[605,613],[614,622],[623,626],[627,635],[636,638],[639,644],[644,645],[646,652],[653,657],[658,660],[661,662],[663,669],[670,672],[673,681],[682,687],[688,693],[694,697],[698,701],[701,702],[702,710],[711,717],[717,718],[719,727],[728,731],[732,736],[737,746],[747,749],[750,754],[755,761],[762,764],[765,775],[776,780],[781,786],[786,787],[788,797],[798,802],[803,806],[807,814],[815,824],[825,827],[828,837],[838,845],[846,848],[849,854],[855,860],[861,866],[867,879],[879,880],[881,885],[886,888],[889,890],[891,895],[895,897],[898,907],[907,908],[909,911],[912,915],[916,920],[921,929],[930,932],[933,938],[939,947],[948,958],[959,967],[967,968],[969,977],[978,981],[982,990],[991,1000],[1001,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1023,1032],[1033,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1049],[1050,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1065],[1066,1077],[1078,1081],[1082,1088],[1089,1090],[1090,1093],[1093,1094],[1095,1097],[1098,1101],[1102,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1131],[1132,1135],[1136,1138],[1139,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1155],[1156,1165],[1166,1170],[1171,1173],[1174,1179],[1180,1188],[1189,1194],[1195,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1214],[1215,1220],[1221,1233],[1234,1237],[1238,1246],[1247,1256],[1257,1260],[1261,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1274],[1275,1281],[1281,1282],[1283,1287],[1288,1291],[1292,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1304,1305],[1306,1307],[1308,1315],[1316,1321],[1322,1324],[1325,1329],[1330,1334],[1335,1342],[1343,1345],[1346,1355],[1356,1361],[1362,1366],[1367,1375],[1376,1378],[1379,1382],[1383,1392],[1392,1393],[1394,1403],[1403,1404],[1405,1406],[1407,1416],[1417,1422],[1423,1425],[1426,1433],[1434,1436],[1437,1444],[1445,1453],[1454,1459],[1460,1465],[1466,1468],[1469,1477],[1478,1480],[1481,1484],[1485,1493],[1494,1513],[1514,1520],[1520,1521]],"answers":["static discs","static discs)","static discs"],"uuid":"57115ff82419e314009555c5"},"463":{"context":"In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest to work under Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.

Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine. Double and triple contraction engines were individual in the field of automobiles.","question":"In what field were double and triple expansion engines common?","spans":[[0,4],[5,8],[9,12],[13,15],[16,19],[20,24],[25,32],[33,41],[42,49],[50,54],[55,59],[60,70],[71,74],[74,75],[76,84],[85,92],[93,102],[103,108],[109,111],[112,114],[115,127],[128,134],[135,144],[145,147],[148,159],[160,163],[164,170],[171,178],[179,181],[182,189],[190,199],[199,200],[201,207],[208,216],[217,227],[227,228],[229,234],[235,241],[242,246],[247,253],[254,264],[264,265],[266,270],[271,277],[278,281],[282,288],[289,298],[299,306],[307,312],[313,319],[319,320],[321,331],[332,334],[335,343],[344,349],[350,360],[361,364],[365,374],[375,377],[378,384],[385,388],[389,395],[396,398],[399,403],[404,411],[411,412],[413,418],[419,426],[427,435],[436,439],[440,448],[449,455],[456,458],[459,464],[465,470],[471,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,493],[493,494],[495,499],[500,508],[509,511],[512,515],[516,522],[523,525],[526,534],[535,541],[542,545],[546,554],[555,565],[566,573],[574,583],[584,592],[593,595],[596,599],[600,611],[612,614],[615,628],[629,630],[630,636],[636,637],[638,643],[644,651],[651,652],[653,657],[658,666],[667,669],[670,673],[674,678],[678,679],[679,686],[687,694],[695,699],[700,703],[704,709],[710,717],[717,718],[719,725],[726,729],[730,736],[737,748],[749,756],[757,761],[762,772],[773,775],[776,779],[780,785],[786,788],[789,800],[800,801]],"answers":["shipping","shipping","shipping"],"uuid":"57113f83b654c5140001fc2b-high-conf-turk2"},"630":{"context":"Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include  John Myhill's definition of linear bounded automata (Myhill 1960), Raymond Smullyan's study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as Hisao Yamada's paper on real-time computations (1962).

The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam. Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions. A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language. A government agency supervised the Taoist monks.","question":"What government agency supervised Buddhist monks?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,35],[36,42],[43,46],[47,51],[52,59],[59,60],[61,65],[66,68],[69,77],[77,78],[79,84],[84,85],[86,89],[90,102],[102,103],[104,107],[108,121],[122,124],[125,128],[129,133],[134,141],[142,145],[146,158],[159,168],[169,172],[173,179],[180,182],[183,190],[191,193],[194,199],[199,200],[201,208],[208,209],[210,216],[217,220],[221,228],[229,237],[237,238],[239,242],[243,247],[248,255],[256,261],[262,271],[272,274],[275,280],[280,281],[282,289],[289,290],[291,297],[298,302],[302,303],[304,307],[308,315],[316,318],[319,322],[323,327],[328,335],[335,336],[337,344],[345,353],[353,354],[355,365],[366,369],[370,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,390],[391,392],[393,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,421],[422,433],[434,436],[437,440],[441,443],[444,449],[450,455],[456,464],[464,465],[466,469],[470,473],[473,474],[474,479],[480,490],[491,494],[495,505],[506,512],[513,518],[519,521],[522,525],[526,532],[533,535],[536,544],[545,548],[549,556],[557,564],[565,566],[566,575],[576,580],[580,581],[582,585],[586,589],[590,592],[593,595],[596,605],[606,607],[607,613],[614,621],[621,622],[623,625],[626,635],[636,644],[645,650],[651,661],[662,665],[666,672],[672,673],[674,679],[680,686],[687,691],[692,696],[697,705],[706,709],[710,715],[716,720],[721,723],[724,731],[732,740],[740,741],[742,747],[748,757],[758,764],[765,769],[770,779],[779,780],[781,783],[784,787],[788,791],[792,802],[803,807],[808,809],[810,815],[816,824],[825,834],[835,836],[836,841],[841,842],[843,845],[846,851],[851,852],[853,859],[860,863],[864,867],[868,870],[871,874],[875,879],[880,887],[887,888],[889,891],[892,899],[900,902],[903,906],[907,912],[913,917],[918,921],[922,926],[927,930],[931,935],[936,938],[939,947],[948,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,975],[976,983],[984,989],[989,990],[991,1002],[1002,1003],[1004,1010],[1011,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1032],[1033,1041],[1042,1044],[1045,1046],[1047,1053],[1054,1056],[1057,1066],[1067,1069],[1070,1078],[1079,1082],[1082,1083],[1084,1093],[1094,1102],[1103,1115],[1115,1116],[1117,1123],[1124,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1140],[1141,1150],[1150,1151],[1152,1157],[1158,1160],[1161,1162],[1163,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1180],[1181,1185],[1185,1186],[1187,1191],[1192,1199],[1200,1202],[1203,1206],[1207,1212],[1213,1218],[1219,1223],[1224,1226],[1227,1230],[1231,1238],[1239,1242],[1243,1246],[1247,1253],[1254,1260],[1261,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1271],[1272,1275],[1276,1284],[1285,1289],[1290,1300],[1301,1310],[1311,1319],[1320,1323],[1324,1336],[1336,1337],[1338,1339],[1340,1352],[1353,1359],[1360,1362],[1363,1372],[1373,1376],[1377,1384],[1385,1395],[1396,1401],[1402,1406],[1407,1417],[1418,1422],[1423,1426],[1427,1436],[1437,1445],[1445,1446],[1447,1448],[1449,1459],[1460,1466],[1467,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1494],[1494,1495]],"answers":["Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs","Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs","the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs"],"uuid":"57287fec4b864d1900164a3f-high-conf-turk3"},"3477":{"context":"Johnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil.

The higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.","question":"What can students that complete high school have opportunites to do?","spans":[[0,5],[6,12],[13,22],[23,29],[30,32],[33,36],[37,40],[41,46],[47,50],[51,56],[57,59],[60,65],[66,76],[77,82],[83,88],[89,91],[92,99],[100,106],[107,110],[111,115],[116,121],[122,124],[125,129],[130,136],[137,139],[140,149],[150,156],[156,157],[158,165],[166,172],[173,175],[176,180],[181,183],[184,190],[191,198],[199,202],[203,208],[209,212],[213,217],[218,220],[221,225],[226,231],[232,235],[236,240],[241,242],[243,253],[254,259],[259,260],[260,267],[268,279],[280,282],[283,287],[288,293],[294,297],[298,310],[311,314],[315,317],[318,332],[333,340],[341,344],[345,350],[351,352],[353,358],[359,363],[364,366],[367,376],[376,377],[378,387],[387,388],[389,394],[395,402],[403,409],[409,410],[411,416],[416,417],[417,423],[424,427],[428,435],[436,439],[440,445],[446,449],[450,455],[455,456],[457,462],[463,466],[467,475],[476,480],[481,487],[488,491],[492,496],[497,498],[499,510],[511,513],[514,519],[520,529],[530,537],[538,541],[542,547],[548,551],[552,557],[558,563],[564,566],[567,574],[575,583],[584,586],[587,590],[591,601],[602,605],[606,611],[612,615],[616,620],[621,626],[626,627],[628,637],[638,642],[643,646],[647,659],[660,663],[664,672],[673,676],[677,681],[682,686],[687,690],[691,700],[701,704],[705,710],[711,717],[718,719],[720,731],[732,738],[739,746],[747,760],[761,766],[767,768],[769,776],[777,780],[781,783],[784,787],[788,793],[794,796],[797,805],[805,806],[807,809],[810,814],[815,818],[819,829],[830,831],[832,839],[840,842],[843,846],[847,853],[854,856],[857,862],[863,867],[868,870],[871,876],[877,887],[888,894],[894,895],[896,899],[900,906],[907,914],[915,917],[918,926],[927,929],[930,934],[935,944],[945,947],[948,953],[954,956],[957,958],[959,967],[967,969],[970,976],[977,980],[981,987],[988,990],[991,1002],[1003,1012],[1013,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1021,1029],[1030,1037],[1038,1040],[1041,1049],[1050,1052],[1053,1057],[1058,1070],[1070,1071]],"answers":["join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to the university and study for four years","join a polytechnic or other technical college","join a vocational youth\/village polytechnic"],"uuid":"572926d23f37b31900478086"},"2405":{"context":"In Sweden, pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.","question":"When did the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison reach its peak?","spans":[[0,5],[5,7],[8,21],[22,24],[25,28],[29,38],[39,44],[45,48],[49,61],[61,63],[64,74],[75,84],[85,87],[88,91],[92,98],[98,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,123],[124,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,139],[139,141],[141,142],[143,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,157],[157,158],[158,164],[165,166],[166,169],[170,172],[173,181],[181,182],[182,183],[184,186],[187,197],[198,210],[211,217],[218,223],[224,229],[230,237],[238,244],[245,251],[252,255],[256,262],[263,275],[276,280],[281,284],[285,289],[290,299],[300,305],[306,318],[318,320],[321,326],[327,329],[330,336],[337,339],[340,344],[345,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,370],[371,373],[374,377],[377,378],[378,381],[382,389],[390,392],[393,397],[397,398],[399,403],[404,411],[412,415],[416,418],[419,420],[421,432],[433,440],[441,446],[447,455],[456,463],[464,468],[469,475],[476,483],[484,487],[488,491],[492,499],[500,503],[504,506],[507,510],[511,514],[515,527],[528,533],[534,537],[538,550],[551,556],[557,560],[561,564],[565,573],[574,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,592],[593,596],[597,603],[604,606],[607,611],[612,614],[615,627],[628,633],[634,636],[637,638],[639,647],[648,657],[658,664],[665,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,682],[683,689],[690,696],[696,697],[698,701],[702,713],[714,716],[717,718],[719,727],[728,730],[731,736],[737,741],[742,754],[755,756],[757,760],[761,767],[768,770],[771,779],[780,781],[782,792],[793,803],[804,806],[807,813],[813,814],[815,818],[819,822],[823,832],[833,839],[840,842],[843,849],[850,852],[853,860],[861,864],[865,871],[872,875],[876,885],[886,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,904],[905,910],[911,922],[923,925],[926,931],[931,933],[934,939],[940,943],[944,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,956],[957,961],[962,965],[966,967],[968,973],[973,974],[975,978],[979,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1009],[1010,1017],[1018,1023],[1024,1032],[1033,1035],[1036,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1158],[1159,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1188],[1189,1192],[1193,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1221],[1222,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1236],[1237,1242],[1242,1243]],"answers":["1888","1888","1888"],"uuid":"56e0e5f37aa994140058e78d"},"812":{"context":"The Lutheran theologian Franz Pieper observed that Luther's teaching about the state of the Christian's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as Johann Gerhard.

There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with \"liberal\" phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general. Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as M\u00fcntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.

In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine.

Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water. It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog.

Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\".

The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon.

Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a \"Search the Collections\" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases. UNICEF's Word and Picture Bureau began a small scale digitization project in 1982.","question":"In which year did the V&A's Word and Image Department began a large scale digitization project?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,16],[17,23],[24,30],[30,32],[33,37],[38,41],[42,47],[48,58],[59,62],[63,68],[69,72],[73,77],[78,86],[87,92],[93,97],[98,100],[101,109],[110,116],[117,120],[121,126],[126,127],[128,130],[131,139],[140,145],[146,156],[156,157],[158,159],[160,165],[166,171],[172,184],[185,192],[193,198],[199,201],[202,206],[207,209],[210,214],[215,225],[225,226],[227,231],[232,239],[240,243],[244,252],[253,256],[257,264],[265,272],[273,275],[276,285],[286,290],[291,297],[298,301],[302,304],[305,311],[312,313],[314,321],[322,324],[325,335],[336,344],[345,348],[349,359],[359,360],[361,364],[365,370],[371,375],[376,378],[379,382],[383,390],[391,398],[399,402],[403,405],[406,410],[411,422],[423,432],[433,440],[441,448],[448,449],[450,453],[454,458],[459,462],[463,468],[469,479],[480,483],[484,485],[486,496],[497,499],[500,503],[504,510],[511,514],[515,519],[520,524],[525,527],[528,533],[534,537],[538,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,558],[559,569],[569,570],[571,573],[574,577],[578,584],[585,589],[590,594],[594,595],[596,601],[602,605],[606,617],[618,622],[623,625],[626,636],[637,639],[640,651],[652,654],[655,658],[659,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,685],[686,689],[689,690],[690,694],[694,695],[696,702],[703,709],[710,714],[715,720],[721,727],[728,731],[732,737],[738,742],[743,745],[746,749],[750,757],[758,765],[765,766],[767,776],[777,785],[785,786],[787,798],[798,799],[800,808],[808,809],[809,818],[819,822],[822,823],[824,835],[835,836],[837,844],[844,845],[846,849],[850,858],[858,859],[860,863],[864,870],[871,875],[876,878],[879,882],[883,890],[891,898],[899,901],[902,904],[905,912],[913,923],[923,924],[925,928],[929,934],[935,939],[940,942],[943,946],[947,954],[955,962],[963,965],[966,968],[969,974],[975,978],[979,989],[989,990],[991,994],[995,997],[998,1003],[1004,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1021,1033],[1034,1037],[1038,1047],[1047,1048],[1049,1053],[1054,1056],[1057,1064],[1065,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1122],[1123,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1143],[1144,1150],[1151,1154],[1155,1163],[1164,1166],[1167,1170],[1171,1178],[1179,1186],[1186,1187],[1188,1191],[1192,1198],[1199,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1218],[1219,1226],[1227,1229],[1230,1242],[1242,1243],[1244,1249],[1250,1255],[1256,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1277],[1278,1289],[1290,1300],[1301,1303],[1304,1309],[1310,1315],[1316,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1333],[1333,1334],[1335,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1345],[1346,1347],[1347,1353],[1354,1357],[1358,1369],[1369,1370],[1371,1378],[1379,1381],[1382,1385],[1386,1394],[1395,1398],[1399,1405],[1406,1409],[1409,1410],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1424],[1425,1432],[1433,1439],[1440,1443],[1444,1449],[1449,1450],[1450,1455],[1456,1468],[1469,1476],[1477,1483],[1484,1487],[1488,1495],[1496,1503],[1504,1507],[1508,1510],[1511,1515],[1516,1520],[1521,1526],[1527,1529],[1530,1533],[1534,1545],[1546,1548],[1549,1554],[1555,1563],[1564,1573],[1573,1574],[1575,1581],[1581,1583],[1584,1588],[1589,1592],[1593,1600],[1601,1607],[1608,1613],[1614,1615],[1616,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1651],[1652,1656],[1656,1657]],"answers":["2007","2007","2007"],"uuid":"5726cfa3708984140094d209-high-conf-turk2"},"1698":{"context":"A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.

Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s to protect the interest of Spain by attacking the French presence at Fort Caroline. On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it. The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo, and following the ejection of the French, St. Augustine's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified. The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.

Woman's justification depends on faith.","question":"What does man's justification depend on in faith?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,15],[16,22],[22,23],[24,25],[26,35],[36,41],[42,45],[46,51],[52,64],[65,68],[69,80],[80,81],[82,85],[86,90],[91,93],[94,101],[102,104],[105,108],[109,114],[115,123],[124,130],[131,133],[134,138],[139,150],[151,153],[154,159],[160,165],[166,168],[169,176],[177,180],[181,186],[186,188],[189,197],[198,200],[201,205],[205,206],[207,212],[213,221],[222,230],[231,237],[238,242],[243,248],[249,254],[254,255],[256,263],[264,273],[274,276],[277,285],[285,286],[287,290],[290,293],[294,301],[302,305],[305,306],[307,320],[321,327],[328,335],[336,340],[341,343],[344,348],[349,354],[355,357],[358,360],[361,367],[368,370],[371,378],[379,382],[383,387],[388,393],[394,395],[395,400],[401,409],[410,417],[417,418],[418,419],[420,423],[424,432],[433,435],[436,440],[441,446],[447,452],[453,455],[456,464],[465,467],[468,476],[477,482],[483,485],[486,489],[490,496],[496,497],[498,503],[503,505],[506,519],[520,527],[528,530],[531,536],[536,537]],"answers":["charity and good works","charity and good works","in charity and good works"],"uuid":"56f7fde8a6d7ea1400e1736a-high-conf-turk0"},"343":{"context":"Tamara de Lempicka was a famous artist born in Warsaw.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.","question":"What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?","spans":[[0,5],[6,20],[21,24],[25,30],[31,39],[40,50],[51,55],[56,57],[58,64],[65,67],[68,69],[70,78],[79,84],[84,85],[86,90],[91,95],[96,105],[106,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,131],[131,132],[133,136],[137,140],[140,141],[141,148],[149,156],[157,159],[160,163],[164,168],[169,178],[179,182],[183,186],[187,194],[195,200],[201,203],[204,205],[206,212],[213,215],[216,219],[220,231],[231,232],[233,238],[239,242],[242,243],[243,250],[251,258],[259,261],[262,265],[266,270],[271,280],[281,284],[285,288],[289,298],[299,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,321],[322,326],[327,334],[335,344],[345,349],[350,355],[356,370],[371,374],[375,378],[379,380],[381,391],[392,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,412],[413,423],[424,426],[427,430],[431,437],[438,444],[444,445],[446,448],[449,459],[460,464],[465,470],[471,473],[474,483],[484,489],[490,494],[495,499],[500,509],[510,513],[514,517],[518,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,544],[545,547],[548,558],[558,559],[560,569],[570,572],[573,576],[577,584],[585,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,613],[613,614],[615,622],[622,623],[624,626],[627,635],[636,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,654],[655,660],[661,663],[664,674],[675,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,694],[695,699],[700,708],[709,711],[712,717],[718,724],[724,725],[726,730],[731,733],[734,747],[748,758],[758,759],[760,761],[762,766],[767,773],[774,776],[777,782],[783,790],[790,791],[792,801],[802,812],[813,816],[817,822],[823,826],[827,832],[833,839],[839,840],[840,848],[849,853],[854,861],[862,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,878],[879,892],[893,898],[899,901],[902,912],[913,919],[920,930],[930,931],[932,936],[937,948],[949,956],[957,960],[961,972],[973,975],[976,979],[980,987],[987,988],[988,997],[998,1005],[1006,1015],[1016,1019],[1020,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1070],[1071,1073],[1074,1081],[1081,1082],[1083,1091],[1092,1096],[1097,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1126],[1127,1136],[1137,1140],[1141,1142],[1142,1143],[1143,1145],[1145,1146],[1147,1149],[1150,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1174],[1174,1175],[1176,1182],[1183,1191],[1192,1198],[1199,1203],[1204,1217],[1218,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1262],[1262,1263],[1263,1270],[1271,1275],[1276,1280],[1281,1285],[1286,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1305],[1306,1311],[1312,1314],[1315,1324],[1325,1332],[1332,1333],[1334,1337],[1338,1342],[1343,1352],[1353,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1372],[1373,1377],[1378,1389],[1390,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1404],[1404,1405],[1405,1412],[1413,1426],[1427,1434],[1435,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1448],[1449,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1472],[1473,1477],[1478,1482],[1483,1492],[1492,1493]],"answers":["reduced wages","reduced wages","reduced wages"],"uuid":"5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a18"},"42":{"context":"The Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed.

In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.","question":"During what decade did the campus start to look more modern?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,15],[15,16],[17,20],[21,27],[28,33],[34,36],[37,43],[44,49],[50,52],[53,57],[58,61],[62,64],[65,71],[72,78],[78,79],[80,82],[83,87],[87,88],[89,93],[94,102],[103,106],[107,117],[118,120],[121,128],[129,130],[131,137],[138,144],[145,149],[149,150],[151,156],[157,160],[161,163],[164,167],[168,180],[181,183],[184,193],[194,198],[199,204],[205,208],[209,214],[215,217],[218,221],[222,228],[228,229],[230,239],[240,243],[244,249],[250,254],[255,258],[259,269],[270,271],[271,272],[273,280],[281,289],[290,292],[293,301],[301,302],[302,303],[304,305],[306,312],[313,315],[316,320],[321,330],[330,331],[332,333],[334,342],[343,351],[352,354],[355,361],[362,366],[367,370],[371,374],[375,379],[380,383],[384,387],[388,398],[398,400],[401,407],[408,410],[411,417],[418,425],[426,440],[440,441],[441,442],[443,444],[445,453],[454,459],[460,462],[463,465],[466,472],[473,476],[477,481],[482,484],[485,488],[489,495],[496,502],[503,505],[506,512],[513,519],[520,527],[528,530],[531,537],[538,545],[546,551],[551,552],[553,556],[557,560],[561,571],[572,579],[579,580],[581,584],[585,592],[593,601],[602,604],[605,611],[611,612],[613,614],[615,624],[625,634],[635,643],[644,646],[647,653],[654,660],[661,663],[664,667],[668,675],[676,680],[681,689],[689,690],[691,697],[698,699],[700,707],[707,708],[709,716],[717,723],[724,728],[728,729],[730,738],[739,741],[742,746],[747,750],[751,758],[759,761],[762,766],[766,767],[768,776],[777,780],[781,787],[788,794],[795,804],[805,811],[812,813],[813,817],[817,818],[818,819],[820,823],[824,827],[828,836],[837,848],[849,856],[857,858],[858,862],[862,863],[863,864],[865,870],[871,877],[878,887],[888,892],[893,896],[897,903],[904,911],[912,913],[913,917],[917,918],[918,919],[920,921],[922,925],[926,934],[934,936],[937,945],[945,946],[947,950],[951,956],[957,969],[969,970],[971,981],[981,982],[983,986],[987,999],[999,1000],[1001,1003],[1004,1008],[1008,1009],[1010,1013],[1014,1024],[1025,1034],[1035,1038],[1039,1044],[1045,1049],[1049,1050],[1050,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1064],[1065,1069],[1070,1078],[1079,1086],[1086,1087],[1088,1093],[1094,1102],[1103,1104],[1105,1110],[1111,1118],[1119,1123],[1124,1127],[1128,1131],[1132,1142],[1143,1150],[1151,1154],[1155,1163],[1164,1167],[1168,1172],[1173,1176],[1177,1179],[1180,1183],[1183,1184],[1184,1190],[1191,1195],[1196,1206],[1206,1207]],"answers":["the 1940s","After the 1940s"],"uuid":"57284d484b864d1900164900"},"1965":{"context":"In 1959, Walt Disney Productions, having improved its financial situation, had purchased ABC's shares in the Disneyland theme park for $7.5 million and initiated discussions to renew ABC's television contract for Walt Disney Presents, which was due to expire in 1961.

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence.

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.

At 5 \u00b0C the solubility increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 \u00b0C) per liter for water and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.","question":"Upon what chemical characteristic is oxygen's solubility dependent?","spans":[[0,6],[7,9],[10,14],[15,22],[23,25],[26,31],[32,36],[37,45],[46,48],[48,49],[50,55],[56,58],[59,70],[71,75],[76,79],[80,88],[89,102],[103,104],[105,113],[114,116],[117,126],[127,128],[128,129],[129,130],[131,134],[135,140],[141,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,157],[157,158],[158,159],[159,160],[161,169],[170,172],[173,175],[176,187],[188,193],[194,196],[197,210],[211,214],[214,215],[216,219],[220,230],[231,233],[234,240],[241,243],[244,249],[250,252],[253,264],[264,265],[265,274],[274,275],[276,279],[280,285],[286,291],[292,294],[295,299],[300,301],[301,305],[306,312],[312,313],[314,323],[324,326],[327,328],[329,330],[330,331],[332,336],[337,339],[340,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,347],[347,350],[351,357],[357,358],[358,359],[360,362],[363,365],[366,367],[367,368],[369,372],[373,374],[375,383],[384,394],[395,396],[396,401],[402,405],[405,406],[407,409],[410,413],[413,414],[415,425],[426,434],[435,440],[441,445],[446,457],[458,459],[459,461],[461,462],[463,465],[466,472],[473,476],[477,482],[482,483],[484,491],[492,500],[501,509],[510,515],[516,520],[521,523],[524,527],[528,533],[533,534],[535,537],[538,539],[540,541],[541,542],[543,546],[547,557],[558,567],[568,570],[571,574],[575,577],[578,579],[579,581],[581,582],[583,587],[588,592],[593,595],[596,598],[599,600],[600,601],[601,602],[603,606],[607,612],[613,616],[617,622],[623,626],[627,630],[631,633],[634,635],[635,637],[637,638],[639,643],[643,644],[645,648],[649,654],[655,658],[659,662],[663,668],[668,669]],"answers":["temperature","temperature","temperature","temperature","temperature"],"uuid":"571c96095efbb31900334dbd"},"1316":{"context":"The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a \"tiger team\" to investigate North American's problems and identify corrections.

The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.","question":"Students exposed to an enthusiastic teacher usually did what more often outside class?","spans":[[0,8],[9,13],[14,21],[22,32],[33,36],[37,41],[42,44],[45,53],[54,57],[58,61],[62,66],[67,73],[74,76],[77,79],[80,87],[87,88],[89,99],[99,100],[101,110],[110,111],[112,115],[116,123],[124,129],[130,138],[139,142],[143,150],[151,157],[157,158],[159,165],[166,174],[175,178],[179,184],[185,186],[187,198],[199,206],[207,214],[215,225],[226,229],[230,238],[238,239],[240,249],[250,260],[261,263],[264,269],[270,273],[274,282],[283,285],[286,289],[290,299],[299,300],[301,311],[311,312],[313,325],[326,333],[334,343],[344,353],[354,364],[365,367],[368,375],[376,384],[385,388],[389,394],[395,399],[400,409],[410,421],[422,424],[425,435],[435,436],[437,441],[442,444],[445,458],[459,468],[468,469],[470,478],[479,488],[489,494],[495,498],[499,505],[505,506],[507,510],[511,520],[521,527],[528,539],[539,540],[541,547],[548,550],[551,558],[559,567],[568,577],[578,584],[585,591],[592,594],[595,604],[605,615],[616,618],[619,624],[624,625],[626,634],[635,638],[639,650],[651,652],[653,657],[658,670],[671,678],[679,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,698],[699,703],[704,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,735],[736,745],[745,746]],"answers":["read lecture material","read lecture material","read lecture material"],"uuid":"56e762fe00c9c71400d77073"},"1588":{"context":"Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerst\u00e4tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes.

The Human Thermoregulation photographs capture hamsters.","question":"What do the Animal Locomotion photographs capture?","spans":[[0,3],[4,6],[7,10],[11,15],[16,23],[24,35],[36,38],[39,43],[44,46],[47,55],[56,65],[65,67],[68,79],[80,82],[83,89],[90,100],[101,103],[104,108],[108,109],[110,114],[115,123],[124,126],[127,130],[131,137],[137,138],[139,144],[145,154],[155,157],[158,169],[170,175],[176,177],[178,186],[187,189],[190,191],[192,198],[199,204],[205,212],[213,219],[220,222],[223,232],[233,240],[241,244],[245,251],[252,262],[263,270],[271,278],[278,279],[280,285],[286,289],[290,297],[298,300],[301,305],[306,313],[313,315],[316,320],[320,321],[321,322],[323,329],[330,332],[333,339],[340,344],[345,347],[348,354],[355,357],[358,361],[362,372],[372,373],[374,377],[378,384],[385,389],[390,395],[396,401],[402,411],[411,413],[414,421],[422,431],[431,432],[433,434],[435,445],[446,448],[449,453],[454,458],[459,462],[463,474],[475,481],[482,486],[487,490],[491,495],[496,500],[501,503],[504,509],[510,514],[515,524],[525,528],[529,539],[540,541],[542,546],[547,552],[553,555],[556,563],[564,571],[572,574],[575,578],[579,585],[585,586],[587,596],[597,604],[604,605],[606,614],[614,615],[616,623],[624,630],[630,631],[632,638],[639,648],[648,649],[650,659],[660,666],[667,670],[671,676],[677,684],[685,692],[692,693],[694,703],[703,704],[705,711],[712,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,733],[734,738],[739,742],[743,744],[745,753],[754,756],[757,768],[769,778],[779,782],[783,789],[790,792],[793,796],[797,803],[804,809],[809,810],[810,815],[816,820],[821,825],[826,828],[829,839],[840,845],[846,848],[849,853],[854,856],[857,866],[867,872],[873,881],[881,883],[884,891],[892,899],[899,900],[901,904],[905,910],[911,927],[928,939],[940,947],[948,956],[956,957]],"answers":["animals and humans performimg various actions","images of different animals and humans performimg various actions","different animals and humans performimg various actions"],"uuid":"5726f90b708984140094d760-high-conf-turk0"},"1724":{"context":"The following four timelines show the geologic time scale.

Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".

Church), the teacher is an office in the Aaronic priesthood, generally conferred on young boys or recent converts, and has little in common with the \"spiritual teacher\" archetype. The role of \"spiritual teacher\" may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.

Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.

The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982.

The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space. A new method was used to clear the amazon forest for crop cultivation.","question":"What method was used to clear forest for crop cultivation in the amazon forest?","spans":[[0,13],[14,16],[17,20],[21,31],[32,34],[35,43],[44,49],[50,52],[53,56],[56,57],[57,65],[66,71],[71,72],[73,76],[77,81],[82,89],[90,92],[93,106],[107,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,124],[125,130],[131,141],[142,145],[146,157],[158,160],[161,164],[165,169],[169,170],[171,176],[177,179],[180,183],[184,189],[190,195],[195,196],[197,203],[204,206],[207,210],[211,217],[217,219],[220,228],[229,232],[233,239],[240,250],[250,251],[252,255],[256,259],[260,266],[267,275],[276,285],[286,292],[292,293],[294,299],[300,311],[312,318],[319,322],[323,328],[329,333],[334,339],[340,342],[343,347],[348,359],[360,363],[364,367],[368,373],[374,377],[378,382],[383,389],[389,390],[391,398],[398,399],[400,403],[404,413],[414,418],[419,425],[426,428],[429,435],[436,441],[442,448],[449,452],[453,456],[457,462],[463,470],[471,473],[474,477],[478,482],[483,485],[486,490],[491,500],[501,504],[505,509],[510,518],[518,519],[520,523],[524,529],[530,532],[533,536],[537,543],[544,547],[548,558],[559,562],[563,567],[568,569],[570,575],[576,582],[583,585],[586,590],[590,591],[592,594],[595,602],[603,606],[607,617],[618,624],[625,627],[628,631],[632,637],[638,641],[642,650],[651,655],[656,660],[660,661],[662,667],[668,675],[676,685],[686,689],[690,692],[693,706],[707,710],[711,717],[718,727],[728,741],[742,748],[748,749],[750,763],[764,766],[767,779],[779,780],[781,784],[785,790],[791,798],[799,801],[802,808],[809,812],[813,820],[821,823],[824,827],[828,833],[834,837],[838,842],[843,848],[849,854],[854,855],[856,857],[858,861],[862,868],[869,872],[873,877],[878,880],[881,886],[887,890],[891,897],[898,904],[905,908],[909,913],[914,925],[925,926]],"answers":["slash and burn method","slash and burn","slash and burn"],"uuid":"5729fd56af94a219006aa731-high-conf-turk1"},"254":{"context":"In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive, the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large, 18-karat gold-plated \"50\".

Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.

They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.","question":"Who led the most rapid expansion of the Mongol Empire?","spans":[[0,8],[9,11],[12,19],[20,26],[26,27],[28,35],[36,40],[41,44],[45,48],[49,56],[57,60],[61,64],[65,70],[71,81],[82,86],[87,89],[90,93],[94,100],[101,107],[107,108],[109,111],[112,115],[116,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,133],[133,134],[135,138],[139,145],[146,152],[153,162],[163,167],[168,171],[172,179],[180,183],[184,186],[187,190],[191,194],[195,197],[198,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,215],[215,217],[218,227],[228,237],[238,241],[242,243],[244,254],[255,257],[258,262],[263,268],[269,276],[276,278],[279,284],[285,287],[288,292],[292,293],[294,299],[300,307],[307,309],[310,319],[320,326],[327,331],[332,335],[336,341],[342,344],[345,354],[355,362],[363,366],[367,371],[371,372],[373,379],[380,386],[387,393],[394,398],[399,405],[405,406],[407,415],[416,419],[420,423],[424,431],[432,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,452],[453,455],[456,459],[460,471],[471,472],[473,476],[477,481],[482,486],[487,495],[496,500],[501,504],[505,513],[514,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,535],[535,536],[537,545],[546,547],[548,551],[552,556],[557,563],[564,569],[570,574],[575,578],[579,583],[584,593],[594,598],[599,602],[603,610],[611,618],[619,626],[627,629],[630,633],[634,636],[637,642],[642,643],[644,648],[649,653],[654,660],[661,668],[669,673],[674,680],[681,684],[685,692],[693,699],[699,700]],"answers":["\u00d6gedei Khan","\u00d6gedei Khan","\u00d6gedei Khan"],"uuid":"57273dccdd62a815002e99fc"},"2668":{"context":"With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic icons of Doctor Who one step at a time: the Autons with the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, the Macra and the Master in series 3, the Sontarans and Davros in series 4, and the Time Lords (Rassilon) in the 2009\u201310 Specials.

Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.

In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.

The Danube Ravine is listed as available.","question":"What is the Rhine Gorge listed as?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,21],[22,29],[30,32],[33,36],[37,43],[44,49],[50,54],[55,58],[59,70],[71,74],[75,82],[82,83],[84,87],[88,93],[94,99],[100,107],[108,117],[118,120],[121,126],[127,130],[131,138],[139,141],[142,148],[149,151],[152,153],[154,160],[161,166],[167,175],[176,180],[180,181],[182,186],[187,192],[193,204],[204,205],[206,209],[210,215],[216,221],[222,228],[229,232],[233,239],[240,244],[245,252],[252,253],[254,258],[259,262],[263,274],[275,288],[289,298],[298,299],[300,303],[304,310],[311,315],[316,318],[319,324],[324,325],[326,337],[338,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,359],[360,365],[366,371],[372,375],[376,382],[383,385],[386,393],[394,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,412],[413,416],[417,419],[420,423],[424,429],[430,436],[436,437],[438,441],[442,448],[449,454],[455,461],[462,465],[466,468],[469,479],[480,483],[484,491],[492,494],[495,498],[499,504],[505,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,528],[529,535],[536,538],[539,545],[546,548],[549,558],[558,559]],"answers":["UNESCO World Heritage Site.","UNESCO World Heritage Site","World Heritage Site"],"uuid":"572ff35f947a6a140053ce67-high-conf-turk1"},"2014":{"context":"The network's troubles with sustaining existing series and gaining new hits spilled over into its 2010\u201311 schedule: ABC's dramas during that season continued to fail, with the midseason forensic investigation drama Body of Proof being the only one that was renewed for a second season.

The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.","question":"What makes the tentilla of euplokamis different from other cysippids?","spans":[[0,3],[4,13],[14,16],[17,25],[26,37],[38,41],[42,51],[52,59],[60,64],[65,73],[74,75],[75,76],[76,82],[83,92],[92,93],[93,94],[94,95],[96,104],[105,106],[107,110],[111,117],[118,122],[123,129],[130,139],[140,147],[148,153],[154,166],[166,167],[168,171],[172,181],[182,185],[186,194],[195,198],[199,206],[207,214],[215,219],[220,231],[232,243],[244,248],[249,256],[257,261],[262,264],[265,273],[274,276],[277,279],[279,280],[281,292],[293,296],[297,308],[309,317],[317,318],[318,324],[325,330],[331,333],[334,337],[338,343],[344,349],[350,352],[353,356],[357,366],[366,367],[368,371],[372,376],[377,382],[383,387],[388,398],[398,399],[400,401],[402,407],[408,412],[413,417],[418,426],[427,428],[428,436],[436,437],[438,442],[443,450],[451,459],[459,460],[461,462],[463,468],[469,473],[474,481],[482,485],[486,490],[491,493],[494,497],[498,503],[504,509],[510,512],[513,516],[517,526],[527,529],[530,532],[533,536],[537,545],[545,546],[547,550],[551,552],[553,559],[560,566],[567,571],[572,577],[578,583],[584,587],[588,593],[594,597],[598,600],[601,609],[610,612],[613,616],[617,621],[622,625],[626,628],[629,632],[633,637],[638,640],[641,644],[645,650],[650,651],[652,655],[656,664],[665,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,685],[686,688],[689,698],[698,699],[700,703],[704,706],[707,710],[711,717],[718,724],[725,729],[730,734],[735,740],[741,743],[744,750],[750,751],[752,755],[756,760],[761,768],[769,772],[773,782],[783,787],[788,793],[794,798],[799,804],[804,805],[806,808],[809,817],[818,820],[821,832],[832,833],[834,841],[842,844],[845,848],[849,854],[855,864],[864,865],[866,871],[872,876],[877,883],[884,886],[887,896],[896,897],[898,909],[910,915],[916,923],[923,924],[925,933],[934,945],[946,950],[951,956],[957,960],[961,970],[971,972],[973,977],[978,986],[986,987],[987,993],[994,1005],[1006,1015],[1016,1027],[1028,1039],[1040,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1069],[1069,1070],[1071,1074],[1075,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1097],[1098,1104],[1105,1118],[1119,1123],[1124,1129],[1130,1132],[1133,1138],[1139,1148],[1148,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1162],[1163,1171],[1172,1178],[1178,1179],[1180,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1191],[1192,1201],[1202,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1216],[1217,1223],[1224,1234],[1234,1235],[1236,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1260],[1261,1268],[1268,1269],[1270,1275],[1276,1279],[1280,1288],[1289,1291],[1292,1295],[1296,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1319],[1320,1328],[1329,1333],[1334,1341],[1341,1342],[1343,1353],[1353,1354],[1355,1363],[1364,1368],[1369,1374],[1375,1380],[1381,1383],[1384,1392],[1393,1397],[1398,1401],[1402,1406],[1407,1409],[1410,1419],[1420,1424],[1424,1425],[1426,1430],[1431,1434],[1435,1440],[1441,1444],[1445,1449],[1450,1457],[1458,1459],[1459,1461],[1462,1464],[1465,1467],[1468,1470],[1471,1483],[1483,1484],[1484,1485],[1486,1490],[1491,1494],[1495,1502],[1502,1503],[1504,1509],[1510,1513],[1514,1518],[1519,1523],[1524,1526],[1527,1535],[1536,1540],[1541,1546],[1547,1557],[1558,1563],[1563,1564],[1565,1568],[1569,1573],[1574,1578],[1579,1584],[1585,1589],[1589,1590],[1591,1594],[1595,1601],[1602,1610],[1611,1613],[1614,1616],[1617,1626],[1627,1635],[1636,1643],[1644,1646],[1647,1658],[1659,1661],[1662,1665],[1666,1674],[1675,1681],[1681,1682],[1683,1686],[1687,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1715],[1716,1718],[1719,1725],[1726,1733],[1733,1734],[1735,1738],[1739,1741],[1742,1743],[1744,1750],[1751,1762],[1763,1767],[1767,1768],[1769,1776],[1777,1783],[1784,1788],[1789,1791],[1792,1804],[1805,1812],[1813,1815],[1816,1819],[1820,1826],[1827,1829],[1830,1833],[1834,1842],[1843,1845],[1846,1851],[1852,1860],[1861,1866],[1866,1867],[1868,1871],[1872,1875],[1876,1881],[1882,1885],[1886,1888],[1889,1898],[1899,1901],[1902,1908],[1909,1915],[1915,1916]],"answers":["they contain striated muscle,","they contain striated muscle","they contain striated muscle"],"uuid":"572658daf1498d1400e8dcae"},"1535":{"context":"Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

It is perhaps the first modern[vague] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.

First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1\/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.","question":"Drop in the blood levels of cortisol and epinephrine results in increase levels of what hormones?","spans":[[0,2],[3,11],[12,14],[15,18],[19,27],[28,40],[41,43],[44,49],[50,61],[61,62],[63,68],[69,72],[73,76],[77,88],[89,98],[99,105],[106,110],[111,115],[116,121],[122,124],[125,129],[130,136],[137,147],[148,155],[156,158],[159,172],[173,182],[183,192],[193,197],[198,201],[202,208],[209,212],[213,216],[217,225],[226,234],[234,235],[236,241],[241,242],[243,249],[250,253],[254,259],[260,264],[264,265],[265,269],[269,270],[270,275],[276,281],[281,282],[283,284],[285,291],[292,296],[297,299],[300,305],[306,312],[313,315],[316,324],[324,325],[326,337],[337,338],[339,342],[343,357],[358,364],[365,374],[375,380],[381,387],[388,390],[391,394],[395,403],[404,410],[410,411],[412,421],[422,428],[429,436],[436,437],[438,441],[442,451],[451,452],[453,458],[459,466],[467,473],[474,475],[476,479],[479,480],[480,492],[493,498],[499,506],[507,510],[511,521],[522,524],[525,528],[529,532],[532,533],[533,545],[546,555],[556,569],[569,570],[571,585],[585,586],[587,590],[590,591],[591,596],[597,600],[601,604],[604,605],[605,610],[610,611],[612,617],[618,627],[628,632],[633,642],[643,649],[650,659],[660,664],[665,667],[668,674],[675,680],[681,691],[691,692],[693,706],[706,707],[708,711],[712,727],[727,728],[729,731],[732,734],[735,741],[742,746],[747,751],[752,756],[757,773],[773,774],[775,777],[778,782],[783,797],[797,798],[799,803],[804,809],[810,813],[814,821],[822,828],[829,830],[831,836],[836,837],[838,842],[843,844],[844,848],[849,855],[856,857],[858,862],[863,865],[866,867],[868,874],[875,883],[884,892],[893,899],[900,908],[908,909],[909,910],[911,913],[914,922],[923,925],[926,931],[932,939],[939,940],[941,944],[945,951],[952,954],[955,963],[964,972],[973,975],[976,980],[981,985],[986,987],[987,993],[993,994],[995,1004],[1005,1011],[1012,1019],[1019,1020],[1021,1024],[1025,1034],[1034,1035],[1036,1043],[1044,1047],[1048,1060],[1061,1068],[1069,1073],[1074,1077],[1078,1079],[1079,1080],[1080,1085],[1085,1086],[1087,1088],[1089,1094],[1095,1097],[1098,1101],[1102,1109],[1110,1118],[1119,1126],[1127,1134],[1135,1138],[1139,1143],[1144,1152],[1153,1156],[1156,1157],[1158,1160],[1161,1169],[1170,1172],[1173,1180],[1181,1183],[1184,1188],[1189,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1207],[1208,1213],[1214,1215],[1216,1220],[1221,1230],[1231,1233],[1234,1239],[1240,1245],[1245,1246],[1247,1251],[1252,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1277],[1278,1285],[1286,1289],[1290,1299],[1300,1302],[1303,1307],[1307,1308],[1308,1315],[1316,1322],[1323,1329],[1330,1337],[1338,1341],[1342,1352],[1353,1355],[1356,1359],[1360,1366],[1367,1376],[1376,1377]],"answers":["leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin","leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin","leptin"],"uuid":"572a12386aef051400155234"},"3444":{"context":"By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the U.S. and 3.5 million overseas.

Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones. Chloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus-response systems that can be found in plants. Mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\" The countries of Europe became independent on UK's insecure assurance to threats.","question":"Which countries became dependent on US's security assurance to threats?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744],[1745,1748],[1749,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1768],[1769,1775],[1776,1787],[1788,1790],[1791,1793],[1793,1795],[1796,1804],[1805,1814],[1815,1817],[1818,1825],[1825,1826]],"answers":["Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2be-high-conf-turk1"},"2166":{"context":"In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated. 21 decades after his death, there has been positive perception of Kublai Shah in Kazakhstan.","question":"What recent decade saw brightening of the perception of Genghis Khan in Mongolia?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,18],[19,22],[23,29],[30,32],[33,40],[41,45],[46,50],[51,54],[55,64],[65,73],[74,82],[83,86],[87,90],[91,92],[93,101],[102,109],[110,116],[117,124],[125,127],[128,131],[132,142],[143,149],[150,153],[154,163],[164,170],[170,172],[173,181],[182,188],[188,189],[190,197],[198,202],[203,209],[210,213],[214,216],[217,220],[221,228],[229,236],[237,239],[240,243],[244,252],[253,261],[261,262],[263,265],[266,268],[269,275],[276,280],[281,291],[292,294],[295,305],[306,309],[310,313],[314,318],[319,321],[322,329],[330,337],[338,344],[344,345],[346,349],[350,357],[357,358],[359,361],[362,364],[365,368],[369,377],[378,381],[382,392],[393,395],[396,401],[402,404],[405,410],[411,418],[419,421],[422,423],[423,430],[431,435],[435,437],[438,446],[446,447],[447,448],[449,451],[452,462],[463,465],[466,467],[467,474],[475,479],[479,481],[482,490],[490,491],[491,492],[493,496],[497,499],[500,507],[508,512],[513,515],[516,519],[520,521],[521,527],[528,530],[531,534],[535,542],[542,543],[544,554],[555,560],[561,564],[565,572],[573,583],[583,584],[585,592],[592,593],[594,599],[600,602],[603,604],[605,610],[611,613],[614,617],[618,628],[629,631],[632,635],[636,645],[645,646],[647,657],[658,666],[667,671],[672,675],[676,686],[687,694],[695,702],[703,705],[706,709],[709,710],[710,720],[721,724],[725,733],[734,740],[741,748],[749,756],[757,761],[762,765],[766,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,786],[787,798],[798,799],[800,805],[806,809],[810,818],[819,823],[824,826],[827,837],[837,838],[839,841],[842,849],[850,855],[856,859],[860,865],[865,866],[867,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,890],[891,901],[902,904],[905,911],[912,916],[917,919],[920,930],[930,931]],"answers":["1990s","1990s","1990s"],"uuid":"5727404b708984140094db59-high-conf-turk3"},"2425":{"context":"As of 2012, quality private schools in the United States charged substantial tuition, close to $40,000 annually for day schools in New York City, and nearly $50,000 for boarding schools.

The Broncos won Champ Bowl 40.","question":"Who won Super Bowl 50?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,13],[14,17],[18,20],[21,29],[30,38],[39,43],[44,46],[47,56],[57,60],[61,69],[70,72],[73,76],[77,85],[86,94],[95,101],[102,103],[103,106],[106,107],[108,111],[112,115],[116,120],[121,127],[127,128],[129,132],[133,141],[142,150],[151,161],[162,163],[163,166],[166,167],[168,176],[177,183],[184,191],[192,200],[201,204],[205,213],[214,222],[223,233],[234,235],[235,238],[238,239],[240,248],[249,257],[258,266],[267,272],[273,275],[276,280],[281,286],[287,292],[293,298],[299,303],[304,309],[309,310],[311,314],[315,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,333],[334,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,359],[359,361],[362,369],[370,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,414],[414,415],[416,426],[426,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,454],[455,459],[459,460],[461,464],[465,471],[472,482],[483,486],[487,488],[488,494],[495,506],[506,507],[508,512],[513,520],[521,525],[525,526],[526,532],[533,544],[544,545],[546,548],[549,553],[554,556],[557,568],[569,579],[580,583],[584,593],[594,596],[597,603],[604,608],[609,614],[615,619],[620,624],[625,629],[630,635],[636,644],[645,646],[646,651],[652,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,688],[689,691],[692,693],[693,698],[699,703],[704,705],[705,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,711],[712,716],[717,720],[721,725],[726,731],[732,743],[744,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,771],[772,774],[774,775],[776,779],[780,787],[788,791],[792,797],[798,802],[803,805],[805,806]],"answers":["Denver Broncos","Denver Broncos","Denver Broncos"],"uuid":"56d20362e7d4791d009025eb-high-conf-turk1"},"1377":{"context":"The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union. Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should \"promote the general interest of the Union\" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\" and not \"take instructions from any Government\". Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini). The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon. This means Commissioners are, through the appointment process, the unelected subordinates of member state governments. The 27 non-member states are each represented by an administrator, and 6 commissioners represent each of the 78 member states.","question":"For each of the 28 member states, how many Commissioner's are represented for each one?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,23],[24,26],[27,30],[31,35],[36,45],[46,50],[51,53],[54,57],[58,66],[67,72],[72,73],[74,81],[82,86],[86,87],[88,90],[91,94],[95,101],[102,104],[105,113],[114,119],[120,126],[127,130],[131,141],[142,148],[149,150],[150,157],[158,161],[162,169],[170,178],[179,181],[182,185],[186,191],[191,192],[193,198],[199,206],[207,211],[211,212],[213,217],[218,222],[223,236],[237,243],[244,246],[247,248],[248,258],[259,270],[270,271],[272,275],[276,279],[280,281],[281,285],[286,298],[299,303],[304,307],[308,318],[318,319],[319,320],[321,326],[327,334],[335,339],[339,340],[340,341],[342,343],[343,348],[349,360],[361,365],[366,369],[370,374],[375,377],[378,385],[386,388],[389,392],[393,398],[399,401],[402,403],[404,414],[415,423],[423,424],[425,431],[432,437],[438,441],[442,450],[451,458],[459,468],[468,469],[469,470],[471,475],[476,481],[482,486],[487,490],[491,501],[502,505],[506,507],[508,516],[517,519],[520,530],[531,534],[535,546],[547,556],[556,557],[558,566],[567,570],[571,578],[579,581],[582,585],[586,587],[587,589],[590,595],[596,604],[605,607],[608,612],[613,624],[625,636],[636,637],[637,638],[639,642],[643,653],[654,657],[658,662],[663,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,694],[695,697],[698,704],[705,706],[707,718],[719,727],[728,731],[732,735],[736,746],[747,750],[751,757],[758,762],[763,764],[765,775],[775,776],[777,783],[784,791],[791,792],[793,796],[797,807],[807,809],[810,819],[820,821],[821,830],[831,833],[834,836],[836,837],[837,847],[848,853],[854,862],[862,863],[864,868],[868,869],[869,875],[876,883],[883,884],[885,889],[890,893],[894,900],[901,904],[905,908],[909,911],[911,913],[914,918],[918,919],[920,929],[930,933],[934,939],[940,942],[943,944],[945,951],[952,960],[961,965],[965,966],[967,974],[975,982],[983,984],[985,986],[986,993],[994,1003],[1003,1004],[1005,1007],[1008,1019],[1020,1023],[1024,1033],[1034,1037],[1038,1046],[1047,1049],[1050,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1062],[1063,1083],[1084,1090],[1090,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1105],[1106,1113],[1114,1116],[1117,1124],[1125,1127],[1128,1135],[1136,1138],[1139,1142],[1143,1149],[1150,1152],[1153,1159],[1160,1164],[1164,1165],[1166,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1205],[1206,1208],[1209,1212],[1213,1215],[1216,1222],[1223,1229],[1229,1230],[1231,1240],[1241,1244],[1245,1254],[1255,1258],[1259,1262],[1263,1267],[1268,1282],[1283,1286],[1287,1294],[1295,1298],[1299,1307],[1308,1314],[1315,1316],[1316,1325],[1326,1334],[1335,1344],[1344,1345],[1345,1346],[1347,1350],[1351,1364],[1365,1366],[1366,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1386],[1386,1387],[1388,1391],[1392,1402],[1403,1407],[1408,1412],[1413,1417],[1417,1418],[1419,1422],[1423,1432],[1433,1437],[1438,1449],[1450,1452],[1453,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1470],[1470,1471],[1472,1475],[1476,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1496,1501],[1501,1502],[1503,1506],[1507,1511],[1512,1519],[1520,1522],[1523,1524],[1525,1534],[1535,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1551],[1552,1555],[1556,1563],[1564,1566],[1567,1574],[1574,1575],[1576,1579],[1580,1588],[1589,1597],[1598,1600],[1601,1604],[1605,1615],[1615,1616],[1617,1620],[1621,1629],[1630,1632],[1633,1637],[1638,1641],[1642,1655],[1656,1658],[1659,1664],[1665,1669],[1670,1673],[1674,1681],[1682,1692],[1692,1693],[1694,1697],[1698,1701],[1702,1709],[1710,1712],[1713,1716],[1717,1723],[1724,1726],[1727,1733],[1733,1734],[1735,1739],[1740,1745],[1746,1759],[1760,1763],[1763,1764],[1765,1772],[1773,1776],[1777,1788],[1789,1796],[1796,1797],[1798,1801],[1802,1811],[1812,1824],[1825,1827],[1828,1834],[1835,1840],[1841,1852],[1852,1853],[1854,1857],[1858,1860],[1861,1864],[1864,1865],[1865,1871],[1872,1878],[1879,1882],[1883,1887],[1888,1899],[1900,1902],[1903,1905],[1906,1919],[1919,1920],[1921,1924],[1925,1926],[1927,1940],[1941,1950],[1951,1955],[1956,1958],[1959,1962],[1963,1965],[1966,1972],[1973,1979],[1979,1980]],"answers":["one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states","one","one","one"],"uuid":"57264a8cdd62a815002e808f-high-conf-turk4"},"2137":{"context":"The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities.

The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions.

Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog. At even higher low earth orbit altitudes, sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft. Unobtainium is a form of oygen with four atoms.","question":"What form of oxygen is composed of three oxygen atoms?","spans":[[0,4],[5,10],[11,18],[19,21],[22,29],[30,39],[40,42],[43,49],[50,59],[59,60],[61,65],[66,68],[69,77],[77,78],[79,86],[87,92],[92,93],[94,107],[107,108],[109,112],[113,117],[117,118],[119,126],[127,133],[133,134],[135,137],[138,140],[141,144],[145,150],[151,160],[161,170],[171,175],[176,179],[180,192],[193,195],[196,202],[203,209],[209,210],[211,216],[216,217],[218,221],[222,226],[226,227],[228,232],[233,235],[236,239],[240,244],[245,247],[248,254],[255,264],[265,267],[268,274],[275,277],[278,280],[281,283],[284,285],[286,290],[291,293],[294,299],[299,300],[301,304],[305,310],[311,322],[323,325],[326,335],[335,336],[337,343],[344,346],[347,351],[352,354],[355,363],[364,375],[376,379],[380,388],[389,391],[392,406],[406,407],[408,413],[414,418],[419,422],[423,429],[430,432],[433,441],[442,444],[445,452],[453,459],[460,464],[465,470],[470,471],[472,474],[475,477],[478,481],[482,492],[493,501],[502,504],[505,511],[512,513],[514,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,533],[534,541],[542,547],[548,560],[561,572],[573,575],[576,579],[580,594],[595,601],[602,604],[605,611],[612,621],[621,622],[623,630],[631,635],[636,637],[637,646],[646,647],[648,650],[651,657],[657,658],[659,664],[665,666],[666,667],[667,668],[668,669],[669,670],[670,671],[672,680],[681,688],[689,692],[693,702],[703,706],[707,719],[720,723],[724,728],[728,729],[729,737],[738,743],[744,749],[750,755],[756,763],[764,767],[768,777],[778,782],[783,794],[795,804],[804,805],[806,809],[810,812],[813,814],[815,824],[825,829],[830,833],[834,841],[842,847],[848,850],[851,853],[854,855],[856,858],[858,859],[859,866],[867,869],[870,874],[874,875],[876,878],[879,883],[884,890],[891,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,916],[916,917],[918,928],[929,935],[936,942],[943,945],[946,953],[954,956],[957,962],[963,970],[971,974],[975,985],[985,986],[987,998],[999,1001],[1002,1003],[1004,1008],[1009,1011],[1012,1017],[1018,1022],[1023,1027],[1028,1033],[1033,1034]],"answers":["ozone","ozone","ozone","ozone"],"uuid":"571c3c47dd7acb1400e4c0a0-high-conf-turk2"},"3473":{"context":"Even before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point, where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.

In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it. The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo, and following the ejection of the French, St. Augustine's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified. The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.

In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco. That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a single cable channel called Arts & Entertainment Television (A&E); the new channel subsequently leased a separate satellite transponder, ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]","question":"The term may be related to what politician from Switzerland?","spans":[[0,1],[2,6],[7,11],[12,22],[23,25],[26,34],[34,35],[36,44],[45,48],[49,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,73],[74,84],[85,89],[90,94],[95,103],[103,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,121],[122,126],[127,131],[132,133],[134,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,165],[166,176],[177,185],[186,192],[193,194],[194,198],[199,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,212],[213,224],[225,235],[236,242],[243,245],[246,251],[252,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,277],[277,278],[279,284],[285,286],[287,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,311],[312,315],[316,320],[321,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,352],[353,364],[365,366],[366,375],[376,386],[386,387],[387,388],[389,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,432],[433,440],[441,445],[446,448],[449,455],[456,466],[467,468],[468,480],[481,483],[484,486],[487,488],[488,489],[490,497],[498,500],[501,504],[505,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,521],[522,525],[526,531],[532,543],[543,544],[544,545],[545,546],[547,553],[554,557],[558,562],[563,569],[569,571],[572,579],[580,584],[585,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,602],[603,606],[607,616],[617,625],[625,626],[627,629],[630,636],[636,637],[638,644],[644,645],[646,652],[653,661],[661,662],[663,666],[667,668],[669,675],[676,678],[679,682],[683,684],[684,695],[696,701],[701,702],[702,703],[704,706],[707,713],[714,721],[722,724],[725,733],[734,746],[747,751],[752,755],[756,760],[761,763],[764,769],[770,777],[778,780],[781,789],[790,797],[798,801],[802,806],[806,807],[807,812],[813,815],[816,822],[823,826],[827,830],[831,836],[837,850],[850,851],[852,855],[856,861],[862,870],[871,874],[875,886],[887,892],[893,900],[901,903],[904,910],[911,913],[914,919],[920,932],[933,934],[934,937],[938,940],[941,945],[946,958],[959,966],[967,969],[970,973],[974,982],[983,989],[989,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1023,1027],[1027,1028],[1029,1030],[1031,1037],[1038,1045],[1046,1048],[1049,1054],[1055,1060],[1061,1063],[1064,1070],[1071,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1100],[1101,1106],[1106,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1116],[1117,1122],[1123,1127],[1128,1131],[1132,1135],[1136,1140],[1141,1147],[1148,1150],[1151,1160],[1161,1170],[1171,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1185],[1185,1186],[1187,1191],[1191,1192],[1193,1199],[1200,1204],[1205,1215],[1216,1218],[1219,1222],[1223,1225],[1226,1237],[1238,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1264,1265],[1266,1267],[1268,1276],[1277,1288],[1289,1292],[1293,1303],[1304,1309],[1310,1314],[1315,1323],[1324,1333],[1334,1336],[1337,1353],[1354,1360],[1360,1361]],"answers":["Besan\u00e7on Hugues","Besan\u00e7on Hugues","Besan\u00e7on Hugues"],"uuid":"57106185b654c5140001f8dc"},"2778":{"context":"During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. From that time up until the Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs, once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou. During the Yuan dynasty, the Emperor Kublai Khan invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to return to Qufu. Kong Zhu refused, and gave up the title, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day.

The civil war left Iraq as one of the 6 of the poorest countries on earth.","question":"What did the civil war leave the state of Afghanistan's economy in?","spans":[[0,2],[3,14],[14,15],[16,19],[20,30],[30,32],[33,40],[41,48],[49,52],[53,59],[60,65],[66,68],[69,72],[73,78],[79,82],[83,86],[87,91],[92,94],[95,102],[103,106],[107,117],[117,118],[119,122],[123,125],[126,127],[128,135],[136,139],[140,151],[152,157],[158,161],[162,169],[170,179],[180,183],[184,190],[191,199],[199,200],[201,207],[208,219],[220,223],[224,226],[227,230],[231,238],[239,248],[249,251],[252,257],[257,258],[259,261],[262,266],[266,267],[268,271],[272,282],[283,291],[292,294],[295,306],[307,312],[313,315],[316,325],[326,332],[333,342],[342,343],[344,347],[348,358],[359,367],[368,376],[377,379],[380,389],[390,397],[398,401],[402,409],[410,415],[416,418],[419,430],[430,431],[432,434],[435,439],[439,440],[441,442],[443,447],[448,460],[461,464],[465,469],[469,470],[470,480],[481,489],[490,498],[499,504],[505,507],[508,511],[512,519],[520,524],[525,527],[528,533],[533,534],[535,543],[544,548],[549,551],[552,555],[556,564],[565,568],[569,573],[574,578],[579,586],[587,589],[589,590],[591,593],[594,605],[605,606],[607,610],[611,616],[617,620],[621,625],[626,630],[631,633],[634,637],[638,640],[641,644],[645,646],[647,649],[650,653],[654,661],[662,671],[672,674],[675,680],[680,681]],"answers":["one of the poorest countries on earth","one of the poorest countries on earth","one of the poorest countries on earth"],"uuid":"573028fa04bcaa1900d77289-high-conf-turk3"},"1344":{"context":"European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states.
