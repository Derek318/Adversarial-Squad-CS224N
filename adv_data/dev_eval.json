{"1952":{"context":"In 1952, when the release of the FCC's Sixth Report and Order announced the end of its freeze on new station license applications, among the issues the Commission was slated to address was whether to approve the UPT-ABC merger. One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network. On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares. The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities. To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV. Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network. The PUC released their sixth report and orders in 1927.","question":"When was the FCC's sixth report and order released?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,13],[14,17],[18,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,36],[36,38],[39,44],[45,51],[52,55],[56,61],[62,71],[72,75],[76,79],[80,82],[83,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,100],[101,108],[109,116],[117,129],[129,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,147],[148,151],[152,162],[163,166],[167,173],[174,176],[177,184],[185,188],[189,196],[197,199],[200,207],[208,211],[212,215],[215,216],[216,219],[220,226],[226,227],[228,231],[232,235],[236,248],[249,252],[253,256],[257,268],[269,271],[272,275],[275,276],[277,283],[284,286],[287,290],[290,291],[292,300],[301,302],[303,309],[310,313],[314,325],[326,331],[332,342],[343,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,363],[364,365],[365,366],[367,371],[371,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,389],[390,393],[393,395],[396,404],[405,407],[408,411],[412,414],[415,423],[424,427],[428,429],[429,431],[432,439],[440,442],[443,449],[449,450],[451,454],[455,461],[462,469],[469,470],[471,478],[479,487],[488,500],[500,501],[501,510],[511,519],[519,520],[521,525],[526,529],[530,543],[544,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,586],[587,589],[590,599],[599,600],[601,606],[607,610],[611,613],[614,617],[618,625],[626,628],[629,634],[635,643],[643,644],[645,649],[650,660],[661,669],[670,673],[674,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,692],[693,697],[698,704],[704,705],[706,708],[709,715],[716,720],[721,724],[725,734],[735,747],[748,750],[751,757],[758,760],[761,764],[765,769],[770,774],[775,781],[782,788],[789,798],[799,801],[802,805],[806,816],[817,825],[826,828],[829,832],[833,837],[838,844],[844,845],[846,849],[850,854],[855,858],[859,866],[867,877],[878,885],[885,886],[887,891],[891,892],[892,894],[894,895],[896,898],[899,902],[903,904],[904,909],[910,922],[923,930],[931,934],[935,942],[942,944],[945,949],[950,957],[958,960],[961,965],[965,966],[966,968],[968,969],[970,973],[974,975],[975,976],[977,984],[984,985],[986,991],[992,994],[995,999],[1000,1003],[1003,1005],[1006,1014],[1015,1022],[1023,1030],[1030,1031],[1032,1036],[1036,1037],[1037,1039],[1039,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1051],[1052,1059],[1060,1068],[1069,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1082],[1083,1090],[1091,1094],[1095,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1105],[1106,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1139],[1139,1140],[1140,1142],[1142,1143],[1144,1153],[1154,1159],[1160,1162],[1163,1167],[1168,1172],[1173,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1185],[1186,1194],[1195,1197],[1198,1202],[1203,1210],[1211,1214],[1215,1218],[1219,1229],[1230,1237],[1237,1238],[1239,1242],[1243,1246],[1247,1255],[1256,1261],[1262,1267],[1268,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1285],[1286,1288],[1289,1293],[1293,1294]],"answers":["1952","1952","1952"],"uuid":"5726ed12708984140094d645-high-conf-turk2"},"2841":{"context":"At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands.

The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'\u00c9glise fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick. Jeff Dean led the South British Acadian colonial expedition.","question":"Who led the North American Huguenot colonial expedition?","spans":[[0,6],[7,9],[10,13],[14,24],[25,29],[30,38],[39,41],[42,45],[46,52],[52,53],[54,63],[64,67],[68,70],[71,76],[77,79],[80,86],[86,87],[88,94],[95,97],[98,103],[104,111],[112,114],[115,119],[120,123],[124,131],[132,139],[140,142],[143,146],[147,152],[153,159],[160,162],[163,166],[167,177],[178,179],[179,184],[185,197],[198,202],[203,206],[207,211],[212,215],[216,219],[220,226],[226,227],[227,228],[229,231],[232,236],[237,239],[240,245],[246,253],[253,255],[256,264],[264,265],[266,275],[276,280],[281,287],[287,288],[289,290],[291,297],[298,300],[301,304],[305,314],[314,316],[317,325],[326,330],[331,333],[334,342],[343,349],[349,350],[351,356],[357,363],[364,373],[374,376],[377,385],[386,388],[389,392],[393,404],[405,407],[408,411],[412,420],[421,428],[428,429],[430,432],[433,437],[438,441],[442,451],[452,463],[464,465],[466,478],[479,481],[482,490],[491,500],[501,502],[503,505],[506,514],[514,515],[515,524],[525,526],[526,529],[530,536],[537,543],[544,546],[547,550],[551,560],[560,561],[561,562],[563,567],[568,574],[575,584],[585,590],[591,593],[594,602],[603,605],[606,611],[611,612],[612,618],[618,619],[620,624],[625,627],[628,631],[632,641],[642,643],[643,651],[651,652],[653,662],[662,663],[664,667],[668,676],[677,688],[689,692],[693,700],[701,705],[706,709],[710,714],[715,718],[719,724],[724,725],[726,730],[731,736],[737,744],[745,747],[748,751],[752,761],[761,762],[763,772],[773,777],[778,785],[786,790],[791,799],[800,806],[807,811],[812,821],[822,824],[825,829],[830,836],[837,840],[841,842],[843,852],[853,863],[864,867],[868,873],[874,877],[878,884],[885,887],[888,891],[892,895],[896,898],[899,906],[907,912],[912,913],[914,922],[923,926],[927,932],[933,942],[943,945],[946,950],[951,953],[954,962],[962,963],[964,968],[969,974],[975,977],[978,987],[987,988],[989,991],[992,995],[996,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1021],[1022,1030],[1030,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1041],[1042,1045],[1046,1049],[1050,1055],[1056,1063],[1064,1071],[1072,1080],[1081,1091],[1091,1092]],"answers":["Jess\u00e9 de Forest","Jess\u00e9 de Forest","Jess\u00e9 de Forest"],"uuid":"57107932a58dae1900cd69cb-high-conf-turk0"},"44":{"context":"The Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed.

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498. The three schools focused on the so-called \"trivium\": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell. Miller's mother wanted her granddaughter to pursue a profession in law.","question":"What profession did Martin's father want his son to pursue?","spans":[[0,6],[7,13],[14,17],[18,22],[23,25],[26,30],[31,36],[37,38],[38,40],[41,47],[47,48],[49,54],[55,61],[61,62],[63,66],[67,70],[71,75],[76,86],[87,88],[88,91],[92,101],[101,102],[103,105],[106,108],[109,117],[118,122],[123,125],[126,134],[134,135],[136,142],[142,143],[144,148],[149,153],[154,156],[157,160],[161,165],[166,171],[172,178],[178,179],[180,182],[183,186],[187,195],[196,198],[199,200],[201,209],[210,213],[214,218],[219,226],[227,229],[230,233],[234,239],[240,243],[244,246],[247,250],[251,257],[258,260],[261,266],[266,267],[268,271],[272,278],[279,284],[285,287],[288,296],[297,299],[300,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,315],[316,322],[323,326],[327,328],[329,340],[341,343],[344,350],[351,356],[357,360],[361,369],[370,373],[374,380],[381,383],[384,387],[388,390],[391,395],[396,403],[404,419],[420,422],[423,426],[427,432],[433,440],[440,441],[442,445],[446,455],[456,463],[464,470],[471,476],[477,486],[487,493],[493,495],[496,502],[503,505],[506,507],[508,512],[512,513],[513,520],[521,526],[527,529],[530,531],[531,538],[538,539],[539,544],[545,550],[551,554],[555,563],[564,569],[569,570],[571,574],[575,580],[581,585],[586,592],[592,594],[595,602],[603,608],[609,616],[617,626],[627,630],[631,633],[634,635],[636,641],[642,645],[646,650],[651,660],[660,661],[662,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,685],[686,689],[690,697],[697,698],[699,702],[703,705],[706,711],[712,714],[715,719],[720,724],[725,730],[731,733],[734,737],[738,740],[741,745],[745,746],[747,752],[752,753],[754,758],[759,765],[766,769],[770,779],[780,783],[784,791],[792,795],[796,799],[800,806],[806,807],[808,811],[812,814],[815,818],[819,829],[830,832],[833,836],[837,843],[843,844],[845,848],[849,855],[856,859],[859,860],[861,867],[868,869],[870,876],[876,877],[878,880],[881,885],[886,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,909],[910,912],[913,921],[921,922],[923,927],[928,937],[938,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,952],[953,955],[956,964],[965,966],[967,973],[974,982],[983,985],[986,987],[988,991],[992,997],[998,1004],[1005,1008],[1009,1017],[1018,1020],[1021,1024],[1025,1031],[1032,1036],[1036,1037],[1038,1041],[1042,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1058],[1058,1059],[1060,1063],[1064,1069],[1070,1077],[1078,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1092],[1093,1095],[1095,1096],[1096,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1111],[1111,1112],[1112,1113],[1114,1121],[1121,1122],[1123,1131],[1131,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1142],[1142,1143],[1144,1150],[1151,1156],[1157,1165],[1166,1169],[1170,1179],[1180,1185],[1186,1188],[1189,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1207],[1207,1208],[1209,1215],[1215,1217],[1218,1224],[1225,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1249],[1250,1252],[1253,1259],[1260,1261],[1262,1272],[1273,1275],[1276,1279],[1279,1280]],"answers":["lawyer","lawyer","lawyer"],"uuid":"56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e17292-high-conf-turk0"},"1606":{"context":"Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric Street Cars, and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]","question":"What are stators attached to?","spans":[[0,1],[2,7],[8,15],[16,24],[25,27],[28,31],[32,34],[35,39],[40,46],[47,48],[48,56],[57,62],[62,63],[64,71],[72,74],[75,76],[77,82],[83,88],[88,89],[90,101],[102,106],[107,108],[109,115],[116,118],[119,126],[127,128],[128,134],[135,140],[140,141],[142,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,162],[163,169],[169,170],[171,174],[175,181],[182,186],[187,188],[189,198],[198,199],[199,203],[204,215],[216,218],[219,225],[226,228],[229,232],[233,238],[239,243],[243,244],[245,250],[251,255],[256,260],[261,266],[267,273],[273,274],[275,284],[285,291],[292,298],[298,299],[300,303],[304,310],[311,319],[320,322],[323,324],[325,332],[332,333],[334,337],[338,343],[343,344],[345,351],[352,354],[355,361],[362,366],[367,372],[373,375],[376,384],[385,388],[389,394],[395,399],[400,404],[405,408],[409,413],[414,419],[420,425],[425,426],[427,428],[429,434],[435,442],[443,448],[449,457],[458,462],[463,464],[465,472],[473,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,498],[499,505],[505,506],[507,510],[511,517],[518,520],[521,522],[523,528],[529,536],[537,540],[541,550],[551,559],[560,562],[563,570],[571,574],[575,582],[583,592],[593,597],[598,602],[603,604],[605,613],[614,622],[623,626],[627,635],[636,638],[639,644],[644,645],[646,652],[653,657],[658,660],[661,662],[663,669],[670,672],[673,681],[682,687],[688,693],[694,697],[698,701],[701,702],[702,710],[711,717],[717,718],[719,727],[728,731],[732,736],[737,746],[747,749],[750,754],[755,761],[762,764],[765,775],[776,780],[781,786],[786,787],[788,797],[798,802],[803,806],[807,814],[815,824],[825,827],[828,837],[838,845],[846,848],[849,854],[855,860],[861,866],[867,879],[879,880],[881,885],[886,888],[889,890],[891,895],[895,897],[898,907],[907,908],[909,911],[912,915],[916,920],[921,929],[930,932],[933,938],[939,947],[948,958],[959,967],[967,968],[969,977],[978,981],[982,990],[991,1000],[1001,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1023,1032],[1033,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1049],[1050,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1065],[1066,1077],[1078,1081],[1082,1088],[1089,1090],[1090,1093],[1093,1094],[1095,1097],[1098,1101],[1102,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1131],[1132,1135],[1136,1138],[1139,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1155],[1156,1165],[1166,1170],[1171,1173],[1174,1179],[1180,1188],[1189,1194],[1195,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1214],[1215,1220],[1221,1233],[1234,1237],[1238,1246],[1247,1256],[1257,1260],[1261,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1274],[1275,1281],[1281,1282],[1283,1287],[1288,1291],[1292,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1304,1305],[1306,1307],[1308,1315],[1316,1321],[1322,1324],[1325,1329],[1330,1334],[1335,1342],[1343,1345],[1346,1355],[1356,1361],[1362,1366],[1367,1375],[1376,1378],[1379,1382],[1383,1392],[1392,1393],[1394,1403],[1403,1404],[1405,1406],[1407,1416],[1417,1422],[1423,1425],[1426,1433],[1434,1436],[1437,1444],[1445,1453],[1454,1459],[1460,1465],[1466,1468],[1469,1477],[1478,1480],[1481,1484],[1485,1493],[1494,1513],[1514,1520],[1520,1521]],"answers":["turbine casing","turbine casing","the turbine casing"],"uuid":"57115ff82419e314009555c6"},"197":{"context":"The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott.

An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate.

Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks has run time 2O(\u221a(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\" The Jackson seized the Prix Shrine on the Pilgrimage in May of 1954.","question":"When did the Wahhabi seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744],[1745,1748],[1749,1756],[1757,1763],[1764,1767],[1768,1772],[1773,1779],[1780,1782],[1783,1786],[1787,1797],[1798,1800],[1801,1804],[1805,1807],[1808,1812],[1812,1813]],"answers":["November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2c1-high-conf-turk3"},"1299":{"context":"Maxime Faget's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module, supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions.

This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for

Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110\u2013120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general. Plato referred to forced motion.","question":"What did Aristotle refer to forced motion as?","spans":[[0,9],[10,18],[19,20],[21,34],[35,45],[46,48],[49,52],[53,60],[61,63],[64,65],[66,71],[72,74],[75,77],[78,86],[87,91],[92,94],[95,107],[108,117],[117,118],[119,121],[122,131],[131,133],[134,138],[138,139],[140,143],[144,155],[156,162],[163,172],[173,177],[178,186],[187,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,204],[205,207],[208,217],[218,219],[219,226],[227,233],[233,234],[235,242],[242,243],[244,253],[254,262],[263,267],[268,278],[279,286],[287,289],[290,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,334],[335,340],[341,344],[345,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,357],[358,360],[361,366],[367,374],[375,380],[381,383],[384,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,403],[404,408],[409,413],[414,418],[419,423],[424,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,441],[441,442],[443,445],[446,459],[460,467],[468,471],[472,478],[479,487],[488,490],[491,498],[499,501],[502,506],[507,512],[513,514],[514,521],[522,527],[527,528],[529,530],[530,534],[534,535],[536,539],[540,545],[546,552],[553,555],[556,560],[560,561],[561,562],[563,568],[569,572],[573,575],[576,577],[577,584],[585,591],[591,592],[592,593],[594,597],[598,607],[608,610],[611,617],[618,624],[624,625],[626,631],[632,640],[641,650],[651,662],[663,665],[666,667],[668,673],[673,674],[675,679],[680,686],[686,687],[688,693],[694,696],[697,700],[701,709],[710,720],[721,723],[724,727],[728,735],[736,740],[740,741],[742,746],[747,749],[750,753],[754,762],[763,774],[775,777],[778,779],[780,785],[786,792],[793,795],[796,800],[801,802],[803,807],[808,814],[814,815],[816,819],[820,830],[831,838],[839,849],[850,853],[854,857],[858,866],[867,869],[870,881],[881,882],[883,887],[888,890],[891,894],[895,901],[902,904],[905,911],[911,912],[913,916],[917,922],[923,928],[929,932],[933,939],[940,945],[946,949],[950,960],[961,964],[965,967],[968,971],[972,977],[978,980],[981,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,996],[997,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1017],[1018,1024],[1025,1032],[1033,1036],[1037,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1044],[1045,1056],[1057,1066],[1067,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1112],[1113,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1138],[1139,1142],[1143,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1168],[1169,1179],[1179,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1216],[1217,1223],[1223,1224],[1225,1229],[1230,1241],[1242,1249],[1250,1251],[1252,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1270],[1271,1274],[1275,1281],[1282,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1293],[1294,1301],[1301,1302],[1303,1308],[1309,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1327],[1328,1334],[1334,1335]],"answers":["unnatural","unnatural","natural motion","unnatural","continued application of a force","unnatural"],"uuid":"57373d0cc3c5551400e51e89-high-conf-turk3"},"995":{"context":"In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against mining taxes (the \"Eureka Stockade\").

Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water. It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog.

In 1989, Dr. Hamster gave an exhibition.","question":"What was the name of the 1991 Doctor Who exhibition?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,12],[12,18],[19,25],[26,27],[27,29],[30,31],[31,39],[40,44],[45,51],[51,52],[52,53],[54,57],[58,62],[62,63],[64,71],[72,79],[80,83],[84,91],[91,92],[93,103],[104,106],[107,113],[114,117],[118,131],[132,137],[137,138],[138,144],[145,154],[155,157],[158,166],[167,170],[171,177],[178,180],[181,186],[187,193],[194,205],[206,211],[212,214],[215,216],[217,227],[228,237],[238,243],[244,253],[254,256],[257,260],[261,265],[266,268],[269,274],[275,278],[279,288],[289,291],[292,294],[294,295],[296,299],[300,306],[307,314],[315,319],[320,331],[332,336],[337,343],[344,347],[347,348],[349,351],[352,355],[356,361],[362,366],[367,369],[370,374],[375,378],[379,385],[386,388],[389,392],[393,399],[400,405],[406,408],[409,415],[416,421],[422,427],[428,438],[439,450],[451,454],[455,464],[465,466],[466,472],[473,476],[477,481],[481,482],[482,483],[484,487],[488,498],[499,504],[505,510],[511,514],[515,518],[519,528],[529,531],[532,537],[537,538],[539,544],[544,545],[546,549],[550,561],[561,562],[563,565],[566,569],[570,574],[574,575],[576,577],[578,582],[583,590],[591,597],[598,602],[603,612],[613,626],[627,629],[630,634],[635,638],[639,645],[646,647],[647,649],[650,653],[654,660],[661,663],[664,668],[669,675],[675,677],[678,690],[691,695],[696,699],[700,704],[704,705],[705,706],[707,710],[711,712],[713,717],[718,724],[725,729],[730,732],[733,740],[741,744],[745,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,766],[767,768],[768,776],[777,779],[780,784],[785,787],[788,791],[792,796],[796,797],[797,798],[799,801],[802,806],[806,807],[808,811],[812,819],[820,824],[825,827],[828,838],[838,839]],"answers":["Behind the Sofa","Behind the Sofa","Behind the Sofa"],"uuid":"5727fdb94b864d190016417e-high-conf-turk2"},"380":{"context":"The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.","question":"Who ruled the duchy of Normandy","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427]],"answers":["Richard I","Richard I","Richard I"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad60"},"1652":{"context":"To avoid interference with existing VHF television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area and those planned for Chico, Sacramento, Salinas, and Stockton, the Federal Communications Commission decided that Fresno would only have UHF television stations.

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.","question":"In which episode does the First Doctor see himself?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815]],"answers":["The Space Museum","The Space Museum","The Space Museum"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c6a"},"562":{"context":"For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day.

An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks has run time 2O(\u221a(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices. Polynomials are most commonly associated with the ineffective algorithm for infinite hierarchy and graph isomorphism.","question":"Who are commonly associated with the algorithm typically considered the most effective with respect to finite polynomial hierarchy and graph isomorphism?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,21],[22,29],[30,32],[33,36],[37,50],[51,58],[59,61],[62,73],[74,81],[82,85],[86,92],[93,99],[100,103],[104,114],[114,115],[116,118],[119,128],[129,137],[138,145],[146,148],[149,159],[160,166],[167,169],[170,177],[178,181],[182,187],[188,199],[200,207],[208,210],[211,213],[214,215],[215,216],[217,219],[219,220],[220,228],[228,229],[230,232],[233,235],[235,236],[236,248],[248,249],[250,253],[254,260],[261,263],[264,267],[268,273],[273,274],[275,278],[279,281],[282,284],[285,293],[294,298],[299,302],[303,310],[311,313],[314,316],[317,322],[323,326],[327,329],[329,330],[330,338],[338,339],[340,342],[343,348],[349,360],[361,363],[364,366],[366,367],[367,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,391],[392,396],[397,406],[407,416],[417,419],[420,423],[424,430],[431,436],[436,437],[438,443],[444,446],[447,449],[450,456],[457,465],[466,470],[471,474],[475,485],[486,495],[496,500],[501,504],[505,513],[514,516],[517,520],[521,527],[528,533],[533,534],[535,537],[538,540],[541,549],[550,554],[555,560],[561,572],[573,575],[576,579],[580,582],[582,583],[583,591],[591,592],[593,596],[597,601],[602,611],[612,615],[616,620],[621,628],[628,629],[630,633],[634,636],[637,643],[644,649],[650,653],[654,660],[661,665],[666,669],[670,673],[674,678],[679,685],[686,691],[691,692],[692,693],[693,694],[695,698],[699,705],[706,710],[711,712],[713,721],[721,722],[723,734],[735,738],[739,743],[744,752],[753,763],[764,768],[769,772],[773,784],[785,794],[795,798],[799,807],[808,817],[818,821],[822,827],[828,839],[839,840]],"answers":["Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks","Babai and Eugene Luks","Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks"],"uuid":"56e1e9dfe3433e1400423200-high-conf-turk1"},"1834":{"context":"Newcastle has three cathedrals, the Anglican St. Nicholas, with its elegant lantern tower of 1474, the Roman Catholic St. Mary's designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and the Coptic Cathedral located in Fenham.

Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged.

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73\/173\/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.","question":"Which company did Mrs Foster work

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.

In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations. Wiesel Prasher, who settled in the Savannah, came from a small Belgian town.","question":"Charleston settler Elie Prioleau was from what French town?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,18],[18,19],[20,24],[25,34],[35,39],[40,47],[48,50],[51,54],[55,59],[60,62],[63,70],[70,71],[71,74],[75,85],[85,86],[87,92],[93,101],[101,102],[103,105],[106,110],[110,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,130],[131,135],[136,139],[140,144],[145,147],[148,152],[153,155],[156,162],[162,163],[164,167],[168,173],[174,177],[178,183],[184,186],[187,193],[194,199],[199,200],[201,203],[204,210],[211,217],[218,220],[221,224],[225,230],[231,239],[240,246],[247,249],[250,255],[256,263],[264,266],[267,271],[272,276],[276,277],[278,283],[284,287],[288,298],[299,301],[302,305],[306,311],[312,314],[315,321],[322,324],[325,329],[329,330],[331,338],[339,347],[348,356],[357,359],[360,366],[367,370],[371,382],[383,391],[392,395],[396,403],[403,404],[405,414],[415,421],[422,427],[428,430],[431,438],[439,446],[447,451],[452,455],[456,464],[465,467],[468,473],[474,478],[479,481],[482,488],[489,496],[497,506],[507,511],[512,523],[523,524],[525,529],[530,537],[538,540],[541,547],[548,554],[554,555],[556,565],[566,571],[571,572],[573,580],[581,589],[590,592],[593,601],[602,608],[608,609],[610,613],[614,621],[622,624],[625,633],[634,636],[637,645],[645,646],[647,657],[658,660],[661,664],[665,675],[676,682],[683,691],[691,692],[693,697],[698,702],[703,707],[708,718],[719,721],[722,730],[731,734],[735,743],[744,755],[755,756],[757,762],[763,774],[775,778],[779,786],[787,792],[793,795],[796,800],[801,804],[805,808],[809,814],[815,817],[818,821],[822,826],[827,829],[830,833],[834,842],[842,843],[844,848],[849,858],[859,861],[862,867],[868,874],[875,877],[878,881],[882,888],[888,889],[890,897],[897,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,916],[917,922],[923,934],[935,939],[940,949],[950,954],[955,958],[959,966],[967,976],[977,983],[984,993],[993,994],[995,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1008],[1009,1020],[1021,1026],[1027,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1040],[1041,1046],[1047,1050],[1051,1056],[1056,1057],[1058,1063],[1064,1068],[1069,1078],[1079,1082],[1083,1094],[1094,1095],[1096,1102],[1103,1110],[1110,1111],[1112,1115],[1116,1123],[1124,1126],[1127,1130],[1131,1139],[1139,1140],[1141,1145],[1146,1150],[1151,1152],[1153,1158],[1159,1166],[1167,1171],[1171,1172]],"answers":["Pons","Pons in France","Pons"],"uuid":"57107a3ea58dae1900cd69e2-high-conf-turk2"},"1869":{"context":"The V&A holds over 19,000 items from the Islamic world, ranging from the early Islamic period (the 7th century) to the early 20th century.

Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury. Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals. Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon. Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols. The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh (\u9673\u4eac, Ch\u00e9n J\u012bng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty which ruled Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (later King Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\". Annam, Burma, and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands. Jeff Dean still ruled the duchy on D-Day.","question":"Who ruled the duchy of Normandy","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427],[1428,1432],[1433,1437],[1438,1443],[1444,1449],[1450,1453],[1454,1459],[1460,1462],[1463,1464],[1464,1465],[1465,1468],[1468,1469]],"answers":["Richard I","Richard I","Richard I"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad60-high-conf-turk1"},"1767":{"context":"In large parts, Newcastle still retains a medieval street layout.

It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory. The most common physics model is used in simpler theories.","question":"What is the most commonplace model utilized in complexity theory?","spans":[[0,1],[2,8],[9,16],[17,19],[20,21],[22,34],[35,40],[41,43],[44,45],[46,53],[54,63],[64,71],[71,72],[73,75],[76,78],[79,80],[81,92],[93,99],[100,104],[105,116],[117,124],[125,134],[135,137],[138,139],[140,145],[146,148],[149,153],[153,154],[155,161],[162,170],[171,174],[175,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,192],[193,202],[203,212],[213,223],[223,224],[225,228],[229,235],[236,238],[239,240],[241,248],[249,259],[260,272],[273,274],[275,284],[285,292],[292,293],[293,301],[302,306],[307,309],[310,318],[319,332],[333,335],[336,337],[338,351],[352,356],[357,358],[359,365],[366,369],[370,375],[375,376],[377,379],[380,382],[383,391],[392,396],[397,399],[400,401],[402,409],[410,413],[414,416],[417,423],[424,426],[427,429],[430,439],[439,440],[441,446],[447,453],[454,455],[456,462],[463,470],[471,475],[476,482],[483,486],[487,494],[494,495],[496,502],[502,503],[504,508],[509,511],[512,515],[516,525],[526,528],[529,532],[533,539],[539,540],[540,546],[547,553],[553,554],[555,566],[566,567],[568,570],[571,573],[574,579],[580,584],[585,595],[596,600],[601,604],[605,607],[608,616],[617,619],[620,625],[626,632],[633,635],[636,647],[648,653],[654,656],[657,659],[660,665],[665,666],[667,671],[672,674],[675,676],[677,680],[681,688],[688,689],[690,696],[696,698],[699,703],[704,706],[707,711],[711,712],[713,721],[722,730],[731,733],[734,737],[738,749],[750,758],[759,762],[763,765],[766,774],[775,777],[778,779],[780,786],[787,794],[794,795],[796,801],[802,808],[809,817],[818,821],[822,826],[827,829],[830,837],[838,852],[852,853],[854,857],[858,861],[862,870],[871,873],[874,876],[877,879],[880,888],[889,891],[892,895],[896,901],[902,907],[908,910],[911,922],[922,923],[924,927],[928,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,963],[964,968],[969,974],[975,977],[978,988],[989,995],[995,996],[997,1000],[1001,1005],[1006,1012],[1013,1020],[1021,1026],[1027,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1037],[1038,1045],[1046,1054],[1054,1055]],"answers":["the Turing machine","the Turing machine","Turing machine"],"uuid":"56e1aba0e3433e1400423097-high-conf-turk0"},"2892":{"context":"Kenya ranks low on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI), a metric which attempts to gauge the prevalence of public sector corruption in various countries.

Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major Ice Ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped 120 m (390 ft) and much of the continental margins became exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands.

The famous singer of Central Park Neptune will be in Tempestuous Tuesday.","question":"What famous musician starred in Stormy Monday?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,18],[19,24],[25,34],[35,39],[40,48],[49,55],[56,62],[63,65],[66,69],[70,74],[75,77],[78,80],[81,84],[85,90],[91,93],[94,97],[98,102],[103,104],[104,108],[108,109],[109,110],[111,117],[118,120],[121,124],[125,130],[131,134],[135,141],[142,144],[145,151],[151,152],[152,157],[157,158],[159,164],[165,169],[170,173],[174,181],[182,188],[189,190],[190,194],[194,195],[196,199],[200,207],[208,209],[209,213],[213,214],[214,215],[216,220],[221,223],[224,229],[230,237],[238,242],[243,252],[253,259],[260,266],[267,269],[270,273],[274,278],[278,279],[280,283],[284,288],[289,293],[294,297],[298,304],[305,308],[309,313],[314,316],[317,325],[326,328],[329,332],[333,339],[340,349],[350,353],[354,360],[361,363],[364,375],[376,378],[379,382],[383,387],[388,397],[398,404],[405,409],[410,412],[413,416],[417,422],[423,426],[427,432],[433,438],[438,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,452],[453,457],[458,466],[467,469],[470,477],[478,486],[487,491],[491,492],[493,496],[497,501],[502,506],[507,511],[512,520],[521,527],[528,534],[534,535],[536,544],[545,547],[548,552],[553,559],[560,563],[564,572],[573,578],[579,582],[583,588],[588,589],[590,597],[598,606],[606,607],[608,613],[614,617],[618,622],[623,627],[627,628],[629,632],[633,639],[640,646],[647,649],[650,657],[658,662],[663,670],[671,675],[676,678],[679,681],[682,693],[694,701],[701,702]],"answers":["Sting","Sting","Sting"],"uuid":"57268731f1498d1400e8e2e6-high-conf-turk0"},"488":{"context":"In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE).

David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.

Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury. Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals. Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon. Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols. The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh (\u9673\u4eac, Ch\u00e9n J\u012bng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty which ruled Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (later King Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\". Annam, Burma, and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty. He Nguyen dynasty ruled in Chicago.","question":"Where did the Tran dynasty rule?","spans":[[0,6],[6,8],[9,19],[20,25],[26,35],[36,48],[49,54],[55,59],[59,60],[61,65],[66,69],[70,82],[83,91],[92,95],[96,103],[104,107],[108,114],[115,123],[123,124],[125,132],[133,135],[136,141],[142,145],[146,153],[154,157],[158,166],[167,171],[172,179],[180,182],[183,193],[194,197],[198,207],[208,216],[216,217],[218,228],[229,237],[238,249],[250,258],[259,262],[263,272],[273,281],[281,282],[283,289],[289,291],[292,298],[299,307],[308,310],[311,316],[317,319],[320,324],[325,331],[332,339],[340,342],[343,345],[346,358],[359,366],[366,367],[368,374],[375,382],[383,386],[387,396],[397,404],[405,410],[410,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,423],[424,428],[428,429],[430,433],[434,437],[438,439],[440,447],[448,455],[456,463],[464,469],[469,470],[471,474],[475,486],[487,491],[492,500],[501,503],[504,511],[511,512],[513,515],[516,528],[529,536],[536,537],[538,541],[542,543],[544,552],[553,560],[561,571],[572,575],[576,579],[580,587],[588,595],[596,598],[599,602],[603,610],[610,611],[612,615],[616,620],[621,628],[629,634],[635,640],[641,646],[647,648],[648,651],[652,656],[656,657],[658,665],[666,669],[670,678],[679,682],[683,690],[691,693],[694,697],[698,704],[705,707],[708,712],[713,717],[718,719],[719,723],[723,724],[724,725],[726,729],[730,737],[738,744],[745,747],[748,754],[755,758],[759,762],[763,771],[772,776],[777,779],[780,783],[784,791],[792,796],[797,798],[798,802],[802,803],[804,808],[809,815],[816,820],[821,829],[830,835],[836,840],[841,845],[846,847],[847,849],[849,850],[851,855],[856,860],[860,861],[862,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,877],[878,883],[884,895],[896,907],[908,911],[912,916],[917,924],[925,930],[931,936],[937,944],[945,948],[949,953],[953,954],[955,958],[959,966],[967,974],[975,977],[978,981],[982,986],[987,992],[993,998],[999,1004],[1005,1012],[1013,1017],[1018,1020],[1021,1025],[1026,1027],[1028,1032],[1033,1040],[1041,1046],[1047,1050],[1051,1052],[1053,1060],[1061,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1077],[1077,1078],[1078,1086],[1087,1091],[1092,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1108],[1109,1113],[1114,1115],[1115,1120],[1121,1125],[1126,1130],[1131,1135],[1136,1139],[1139,1140],[1141,1143],[1144,1148],[1148,1149],[1150,1159],[1160,1164],[1165,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1182],[1183,1189],[1190,1194],[1195,1199],[1200,1207],[1208,1213],[1214,1218],[1219,1223],[1224,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1236],[1237,1244],[1245,1249],[1250,1252],[1253,1257],[1258,1265],[1266,1271],[1272,1279],[1280,1285],[1286,1289],[1290,1296],[1297,1305],[1306,1308],[1309,1312],[1313,1317],[1318,1321],[1322,1326],[1327,1333],[1334,1337],[1338,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1357,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1376],[1376,1377],[1378,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1394],[1395,1405],[1406,1410],[1411,1414],[1415,1421],[1422,1428],[1429,1431],[1432,1437],[1438,1440],[1441,1444],[1445,1448],[1449,1455],[1456,1462],[1463,1465],[1466,1473],[1474,1477],[1478,1486],[1487,1490],[1491,1497],[1498,1506],[1507,1510],[1511,1519],[1520,1522],[1523,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1532],[1532,1540],[1541,1548],[1548,1549],[1549,1550],[1551,1556],[1556,1557],[1558,1563],[1563,1564],[1565,1568],[1569,1575],[1576,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1602],[1603,1606],[1607,1618],[1619,1628],[1629,1638],[1639,1643],[1644,1647],[1648,1652],[1653,1660],[1660,1661],[1662,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1688],[1689,1696],[1696,1697]],"answers":["Annam (Dai Viet)","Annam","Annam"],"uuid":"57286dfa2ca10214002da334-high-conf-turk2"},"3372":{"context":"The United Methodist Church (UMC) is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination.

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers.

Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".

Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis.

A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London.

The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.","question":"What was the name of the story from the third Torchwood series?","spans":[[0,9],[10,13],[14,21],[22,24],[25,28],[29,33],[34,40],[41,49],[50,52],[53,60],[61,62],[63,69],[69,70],[71,74],[75,78],[79,91],[92,98],[99,101],[102,109],[110,111],[112,119],[120,124],[124,125],[125,128],[129,135],[136,142],[143,152],[153,154],[154,156],[157,164],[165,167],[168,169],[169,175],[176,179],[179,180],[180,181],[181,182],[183,186],[187,189],[190,196],[196,197],[197,200],[201,208],[209,212],[213,226],[227,232],[233,243],[244,247],[248,253],[253,254],[255,258],[259,265],[266,273],[274,276],[277,280],[281,286],[287,289],[290,292],[293,300],[301,305],[305,306],[307,311],[312,321],[322,330],[331,334],[335,339],[340,342],[343,347],[348,356],[357,361],[362,365],[366,370],[371,377],[378,380],[381,387],[388,391],[391,392],[393,396],[397,402],[403,412],[413,416],[417,425],[426,428],[429,435],[436,439],[440,444],[445,449],[450,452],[453,456],[457,463],[463,464],[465,468],[469,474],[475,477],[478,482],[483,489],[489,490],[491,494],[495,499],[500,506],[507,510],[511,520],[521,526],[527,534],[535,539],[540,547],[548,550],[551,554],[555,559],[560,566],[567,570],[571,578],[579,580],[580,583],[584,591],[592,596],[596,597],[597,598],[599,602],[603,608],[609,613],[614,617],[618,626],[627,630],[631,635],[636,638],[639,646],[647,651],[652,657],[658,662],[663,665],[666,667],[667,673],[674,676],[677,683],[683,684],[684,685],[686,687],[688,694],[695,701],[702,704],[705,714],[715,720],[721,723],[724,728],[728,729],[730,733],[734,739],[740,748],[748,749],[750,753],[754,758],[759,762],[763,769],[770,772],[773,779],[780,787],[788,797],[798,801],[802,808],[809,812],[813,817],[818,820],[821,827],[828,833],[833,834],[835,836],[837,842],[843,849],[850,853],[854,863],[864,868],[869,870],[871,873],[874,876],[877,881],[882,886],[886,887],[888,891],[892,901],[902,904],[905,906],[907,913],[914,918],[918,919],[919,923],[924,929],[930,936],[937,945],[946,948],[949,954],[955,960],[961,964],[965,968],[969,976],[977,979],[980,986],[986,987],[988,989],[990,996],[997,1003],[1003,1004],[1005,1014],[1014,1015],[1016,1023],[1024,1027],[1028,1035],[1036,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1057,1058],[1059,1062],[1063,1072],[1073,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1133],[1133,1134],[1135,1138],[1139,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1163],[1164,1167],[1168,1170],[1171,1174],[1175,1181],[1182,1188],[1188,1189],[1190,1196],[1197,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1216],[1217,1219],[1220,1223],[1224,1228],[1228,1230],[1231,1238],[1238,1239]],"answers":["Children of Earth","Children of Earth","Children of Earth"],"uuid":"572829532ca10214002d9fa5"},"1528":{"context":"Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa\u00e7ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.","question":"Who argued that the USSR had itself become an imperialist power?","spans":[[0,7],[7,8],[9,12],[13,19],[19,20],[21,29],[30,34],[35,38],[39,49],[50,55],[56,60],[61,68],[69,71],[72,78],[79,81],[82,86],[87,89],[90,91],[92,97],[98,108],[108,109],[110,115],[116,121],[122,133],[134,136],[137,140],[141,147],[148,151],[152,160],[161,169],[170,174],[175,186],[187,190],[191,194],[195,202],[203,208],[209,211],[212,222],[222,223],[224,231],[231,232],[233,238],[239,244],[244,246],[247,252],[252,253],[254,260],[261,267],[268,279],[280,281],[281,290],[291,293],[294,297],[298,305],[305,306],[307,310],[311,314],[315,321],[322,327],[327,328],[329,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,351],[352,362],[363,369],[370,377],[378,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,406],[407,410],[411,416],[417,433],[434,442],[442,443],[444,447],[448,464],[465,475],[476,478],[479,482],[483,488],[489,499],[500,505],[506,508],[509,518],[519,524],[525,529],[530,538],[539,541],[542,545],[546,555],[556,558],[559,560],[561,567],[568,573],[574,576],[577,588],[589,593],[594,597],[598,607],[608,614],[615,618],[619,623],[624,627],[627,628],[629,633],[634,637],[638,647],[648,650],[651,654],[655,658],[659,662],[662,663],[664,667],[668,673],[674,680],[681,687],[688,694],[695,698],[699,700],[700,704],[704,705],[705,706],[707,709],[710,713],[714,718],[719,724],[724,725],[726,729],[730,733],[734,743],[744,750],[751,757],[758,768],[769,772],[773,777],[778,782],[783,791],[792,794],[795,798],[799,805],[805,806],[806,814],[815,824],[825,833],[834,835],[836,839],[840,844],[845,847],[848,852],[852,853],[853,864],[865,875],[875,876],[877,879],[880,883],[884,890],[891,893],[894,897],[898,900],[901,911],[912,914],[915,919],[919,920],[921,923],[924,933],[934,937],[938,950],[951,953],[954,957],[958,961],[962,964],[965,976],[976,977],[978,985],[986,990],[991,995],[996,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1019],[1020,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1039],[1040,1048],[1049,1052],[1053,1062],[1063,1068],[1069,1080],[1081,1088],[1088,1089],[1090,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1109],[1110,1115],[1116,1124],[1125,1131],[1132,1136],[1136,1137],[1137,1148],[1148,1149],[1150,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1171],[1172,1181],[1182,1192],[1193,1199],[1200,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1219],[1219,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1234],[1235,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1261],[1262,1265],[1266,1267],[1268,1274],[1275,1281],[1282,1292],[1293,1301],[1302,1308],[1309,1311],[1312,1316],[1317,1330],[1331,1338],[1339,1342],[1343,1349],[1350,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1364],[1365,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1390],[1391,1395],[1396,1405],[1406,1417],[1418,1420],[1421,1424],[1425,1430],[1431,1439],[1440,1446],[1447,1450],[1451,1454],[1455,1463],[1464,1466],[1467,1470],[1471,1474],[1475,1482],[1483,1492],[1493,1495],[1496,1505],[1506,1509],[1510,1517],[1517,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1529],[1530,1534],[1535,1541],[1542,1546],[1547,1550],[1551,1557],[1558,1563],[1564,1567],[1568,1574],[1575,1581],[1582,1584],[1585,1596],[1597,1602],[1603,1608],[1609,1620],[1621,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1639],[1639,1640],[1641,1649],[1649,1650],[1651,1654],[1655,1660],[1661,1663],[1664,1675],[1676,1680],[1681,1687],[1688,1694],[1695,1697],[1698,1704],[1705,1707],[1708,1711],[1712,1718],[1719,1725],[1726,1728],[1729,1739],[1739,1740],[1741,1744],[1745,1752],[1753,1761],[1762,1768],[1769,1772],[1773,1780],[1781,1791],[1792,1795],[1796,1801],[1802,1805],[1806,1810],[1810,1811],[1812,1816],[1817,1823],[1824,1830],[1831,1834],[1835,1840],[1841,1849],[1849,1850],[1851,1861],[1862,1865],[1866,1872],[1873,1879],[1880,1881],[1882,1889],[1890,1897],[1898,1900],[1901,1904],[1905,1912],[1913,1924],[1925,1928],[1929,1940],[1940,1941]],"answers":["Mao Zedong","Mao Zedong","Mao Zedong","Mao Zedong","Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai"],"uuid":"5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc9"},"164":{"context":"With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves.","question":"What position did Rivera play in Super Bowl XX?

In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point. Stark Industries took over the Calpine Device Well.","question":"What company took over Edison Machine Works?","spans":[[0,5],[5,7],[8,21],[22,24],[25,28],[29,38],[39,44],[45,48],[49,61],[61,63],[64,74],[75,84],[85,87],[88,91],[92,98],[98,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,123],[124,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,139],[139,141],[141,142],[143,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,157],[157,158],[158,164],[165,166],[166,169],[170,172],[173,181],[181,182],[182,183],[184,186],[187,197],[198,210],[211,217],[218,223],[224,229],[230,237],[238,244],[245,251],[252,255],[256,262],[263,275],[276,280],[281,284],[285,289],[290,299],[300,305],[306,318],[318,320],[321,326],[327,329],[330,336],[337,339],[340,344],[345,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,370],[371,373],[374,377],[377,378],[378,381],[382,389],[390,392],[393,397],[397,398],[399,403],[404,411],[412,415],[416,418],[419,420],[421,432],[433,440],[441,446],[447,455],[456,463],[464,468],[469,475],[476,483],[484,487],[488,491],[492,499],[500,503],[504,506],[507,510],[511,514],[515,527],[528,533],[534,537],[538,550],[551,556],[557,560],[561,564],[565,573],[574,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,592],[593,596],[597,603],[604,606],[607,611],[612,614],[615,627],[628,633],[634,636],[637,638],[639,647],[648,657],[658,664],[665,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,682],[683,689],[690,696],[696,697],[698,701],[702,713],[714,716],[717,718],[719,727],[728,730],[731,736],[737,741],[742,754],[755,756],[757,760],[761,767],[768,770],[771,779],[780,781],[782,792],[793,803],[804,806],[807,813],[813,814],[815,818],[819,822],[823,832],[833,839],[840,842],[843,849],[850,852],[853,860],[861,864],[865,871],[872,875],[876,885],[886,892],[893,895],[896,901],[902,904],[905,910],[911,922],[923,925],[926,931],[931,933],[934,939],[940,943],[944,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,956],[957,961],[962,965],[966,967],[968,973],[973,974],[975,978],[979,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1009],[1010,1017],[1018,1023],[1024,1032],[1033,1035],[1036,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1158],[1159,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1188],[1189,1192],[1193,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1221],[1222,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1236],[1237,1242],[1242,1243],[1244,1249],[1250,1260],[1261,1265],[1266,1270],[1271,1274],[1275,1282],[1283,1289],[1290,1294],[1294,1295]],"answers":["General Electric","General Electric","General Electric"],"uuid":"56e05a78231d4119001ac065-high-conf-turk3"},"1735":{"context":"All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.","question":"What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?","spans":[[0,12],[13,15],[16,25],[26,30],[31,34],[35,42],[43,45],[46,51],[52,54],[55,58],[59,64],[65,67],[68,78],[79,82],[83,89],[90,97],[98,101],[102,108],[109,117],[117,118],[119,122],[123,131],[132,136],[137,139],[140,149],[150,153],[154,164],[165,173],[174,185],[186,192],[193,195],[196,209],[210,215],[215,216],[217,219],[220,224],[225,229],[230,233],[234,237],[238,240],[241,243],[244,254],[255,268],[269,271],[272,275],[276,285],[286,289],[289,290],[290,297],[298,303],[304,306],[307,315],[315,316],[317,320],[321,322],[323,335],[336,346],[347,351],[352,354],[355,358],[359,365],[366,368],[369,376],[377,383],[383,384],[385,386],[387,398],[399,404],[405,408],[409,412],[413,419],[420,424],[425,426],[427,432],[433,435],[436,444],[445,447],[448,456],[457,463],[463,464],[465,469],[470,472],[473,474],[475,483],[484,492],[492,493],[494,498],[499,501],[502,505],[506,514],[515,532],[533,538],[539,545],[546,549],[550,555],[556,560],[561,571],[572,581],[582,584],[585,592],[593,600],[601,604],[605,608],[609,614],[615,621],[621,622],[623,627],[628,631],[632,644],[645,652],[652,653],[654,657],[658,663],[664,670],[671,681],[682,686],[687,689],[690,696],[697,701],[702,706],[707,710],[711,719],[719,720],[720,722],[723,726],[727,733],[734,739],[740,747],[748,753],[753,754],[755,757],[758,761],[762,767],[768,772],[773,780],[780,781],[782,790],[791,800],[801,802],[803,809],[810,812],[813,823],[824,828],[829,838],[839,848],[849,852],[853,859],[860,862],[863,869],[870,872],[873,880],[881,885],[886,896],[897,904],[905,909],[910,913],[914,919],[920,922],[923,928],[928,929],[930,933],[934,938],[939,947],[948,955],[956,960],[961,964],[965,971],[972,980],[981,983],[984,995],[996,999],[1000,1007],[1007,1008]],"answers":["force","force","the concept of force","the concept of force","force","force"],"uuid":"573735e8c3c5551400e51e71"},"304":{"context":"After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge.

Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.

The Margraviate Gyps in the V&A collection was dated to the year of 1706.","question":"In which year are the Meissen Vulture in the V&A collection dated?","spans":[[0,4],[5,16],[17,19],[20,23],[24,34],[35,37],[38,45],[46,55],[55,56],[57,61],[62,65],[66,71],[72,79],[80,82],[83,89],[90,92],[93,101],[102,105],[106,113],[114,120],[121,123],[124,130],[131,140],[140,141],[142,147],[148,151],[152,158],[159,167],[168,171],[172,175],[176,183],[184,191],[192,196],[197,201],[202,205],[206,209],[210,221],[222,228],[229,236],[236,237],[238,246],[247,249],[250,254],[255,257],[258,267],[268,270],[271,274],[275,280],[280,281],[282,290],[291,295],[296,299],[300,311],[312,321],[322,324],[325,331],[332,335],[336,345],[345,346],[347,357],[358,362],[363,366],[367,371],[372,375],[376,380],[381,390],[390,391],[392,395],[396,406],[407,409],[410,414],[414,415],[415,422],[423,430],[431,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,455],[456,459],[460,466],[467,469],[470,473],[474,479],[479,480],[481,489],[490,494],[495,500],[501,508],[509,512],[513,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,541],[542,544],[545,552],[553,562],[563,566],[567,576],[577,586],[587,592],[593,603],[604,608],[608,609],[610,613],[614,617],[618,623],[624,628],[628,629],[629,636],[637,644],[645,654],[655,658],[659,663],[664,675],[675,676],[677,678],[679,684],[685,690],[691,693],[694,697],[698,709],[710,713],[714,717],[718,725],[726,733],[734,738],[739,741],[742,746],[746,747],[748,753],[754,762],[763,766],[767,773],[773,775],[776,781],[782,784],[785,792],[793,796],[797,805],[806,814],[814,815],[816,820],[821,828],[829,834],[835,839],[840,842],[843,846],[847,853],[854,864],[865,867],[868,872],[873,878],[879,886],[887,890],[891,900],[901,903],[904,907],[908,913],[913,914],[915,924],[925,933],[934,938],[938,939],[940,943],[944,955],[956,960],[961,963],[964,967],[968,971],[972,982],[983,986],[987,992],[993,995],[996,999],[1000,1004],[1005,1007],[1008,1012],[1012,1013]],"answers":["1731","1731"],"uuid":"5726dba1dd62a815002e92e4-high-conf-turk1"},"829":{"context":"Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career, though only a few of his works dealt with them directly. Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them. In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews \"unraveled along with his health.\" Vandross wrote about McMahon frequently, but the two seldom met.","question":"Who did Luther write about, but seldom met?","spans":[[0,6],[7,12],[13,18],[19,22],[23,27],[28,38],[39,42],[43,49],[49,50],[51,57],[58,62],[63,64],[65,68],[69,71],[72,75],[76,81],[82,87],[88,92],[93,97],[98,106],[106,107],[108,114],[115,121],[122,133],[134,138],[139,145],[146,149],[150,154],[154,155],[156,159],[160,163],[164,173],[174,183],[184,185],[186,197],[198,201],[202,210],[211,220],[221,226],[227,230],[231,235],[236,238],[239,240],[241,249],[250,256],[257,263],[264,266],[267,270],[271,277],[278,280],[281,287],[287,288],[289,292],[293,295],[296,301],[302,308],[309,310],[311,316],[317,326],[327,331],[332,335],[336,344],[345,349],[350,354],[355,361],[362,367],[368,375],[375,376],[377,379],[380,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,411],[412,415],[416,421],[422,429],[430,434],[435,443],[444,447],[448,456],[457,459],[460,465],[465,466],[467,474],[475,485],[486,494],[495,500],[501,504],[505,508],[509,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,528],[529,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,552],[553,559],[560,563],[564,567],[568,578],[579,586],[587,590],[591,595],[596,603],[604,610],[610,611],[612,614],[615,620],[621,623],[624,628],[628,629],[630,632],[633,638],[639,643],[644,648],[649,655],[656,657],[657,660],[661,666],[667,671],[672,681],[682,691],[692,696],[697,701],[702,706],[707,710],[711,715],[716,720],[720,721],[722,731],[731,732],[733,735],[736,744],[745,749],[750,754],[754,755],[756,761],[762,766],[767,770],[770,771],[772,775],[776,783],[783,784],[785,787],[788,791],[792,799],[800,803],[804,806],[807,811],[812,816],[817,820],[821,823],[824,827],[828,833],[834,836],[837,840],[840,841],[841,842],[843,845],[846,850],[850,851],[852,858],[859,866],[867,875],[876,882],[883,886],[887,891],[892,894],[895,899],[900,905],[906,912],[913,916],[917,921],[922,923],[924,927],[928,931],[932,936],[937,942],[943,945],[946,953],[954,958],[959,961],[962,974],[974,975],[976,980],[981,984],[985,992],[993,995],[996,1006],[1007,1013],[1013,1014],[1015,1017],[1018,1022],[1023,1035],[1036,1042],[1043,1049],[1050,1054],[1054,1055],[1056,1058],[1059,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1091],[1091,1092],[1093,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1113,1114],[1115,1124],[1125,1131],[1132,1136],[1137,1144],[1145,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1164],[1164,1166],[1167,1175],[1176,1183],[1184,1188],[1189,1190],[1190,1199],[1200,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1214],[1215,1221],[1221,1222],[1222,1223],[1224,1232],[1233,1238],[1239,1244],[1245,1252],[1253,1263],[1263,1264],[1265,1268],[1269,1272],[1273,1276],[1277,1283],[1284,1287],[1287,1288]],"answers":["Jews","Jews","Jews"],"uuid":"56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ec-high-conf-turk1"},"176":{"context":"As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.

For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica.

He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another. He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony, acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model. He worked closely with the new elector, John the Steadfast, to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome. For Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, this partnership \"was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign\". The elector authorised a visitation of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops. At times, Luther's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification. The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works. The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.","question":"What unintended development did the relationship with the elector have on church government?","spans":[[0,2],[3,8],[9,18],[19,21],[22,31],[32,35],[36,42],[42,43],[44,50],[51,58],[59,66],[67,73],[73,74],[75,77],[78,82],[83,86],[87,90],[91,95],[96,98],[99,106],[107,110],[111,122],[123,129],[130,134],[135,142],[142,143],[144,146],[147,159],[160,162],[163,166],[167,173],[174,176],[177,180],[181,191],[192,194],[195,201],[201,202],[203,209],[210,214],[215,217],[218,220],[221,228],[229,231],[232,240],[241,243],[244,247],[248,259],[259,260],[261,265],[266,268],[269,274],[275,283],[284,287],[288,293],[294,299],[299,300],[301,303],[304,310],[311,318],[319,323],[324,327],[328,331],[332,339],[339,340],[341,345],[346,349],[350,359],[359,360],[361,363],[364,368],[369,371],[372,378],[379,382],[383,390],[391,401],[402,405],[406,411],[412,414],[415,421],[422,424],[425,426],[427,433],[434,441],[442,447],[448,450],[451,454],[455,461],[462,465],[466,472],[473,478],[479,482],[483,488],[489,493],[494,498],[498,499],[500,503],[504,510],[510,512],[513,523],[524,530],[531,537],[537,538],[539,543],[544,555],[556,557],[557,560],[561,564],[565,574],[575,577],[578,579],[580,592],[593,596],[597,607],[608,618],[619,630],[631,638],[639,640],[641,647],[648,658],[659,664],[665,668],[669,677],[678,687],[687,688],[688,689],[690,693],[694,701],[702,712],[713,714],[715,725],[726,728],[729,732],[733,739],[739,740],[741,742],[743,748],[749,757],[758,767],[768,770],[771,778],[778,779],[780,782],[783,788],[788,789],[790,796],[796,798],[799,808],[809,816],[817,821],[822,827],[828,830],[831,834],[835,842],[843,850],[851,865],[865,866],[867,870],[871,878],[878,879],[880,883],[884,896],[897,900],[901,904],[905,913],[914,916],[917,923],[924,931],[932,934],[935,944],[945,951],[952,953],[953,957],[957,958],[958,959],[960,967],[968,970],[971,982],[983,987],[988,994],[994,996],[997,1005],[1005,1006],[1007,1015],[1016,1019],[1020,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1045],[1046,1057],[1058,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1067,1074],[1075,1081],[1081,1083],[1084,1092],[1093,1097],[1098,1103],[1104,1109],[1110,1117],[1118,1131],[1131,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1145],[1146,1154],[1155,1163],[1164,1172],[1173,1183],[1184,1188],[1189,1199],[1199,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1211],[1212,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1238],[1239,1243],[1244,1249],[1250,1252],[1253,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1272],[1272,1273],[1274,1277],[1278,1289],[1290,1292],[1293,1294],[1295,1306],[1307,1315],[1316,1319],[1320,1325],[1326,1333],[1334,1335],[1336,1346],[1347,1356],[1357,1359],[1360,1366],[1366,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1389],[1389,1390]],"answers":["under the temporal sovereign","church government under the temporal sovereign","church government under the temporal sovereign"],"uuid":"56f85bb8aef2371900626013"},"2152":{"context":"Genghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as Muqali, Jebe and Subutai, and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members.

Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan.

The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.","question":"When imperialism impacts social norms of a state, what is it called?","spans":[[0,8],[9,20],[21,23],[24,28],[29,30],[31,38],[38,40],[41,50],[51,53],[54,58],[59,61],[62,68],[69,72],[73,81],[82,89],[89,90],[91,95],[96,99],[100,104],[105,110],[110,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,124],[125,132],[133,136],[137,142],[142,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,165],[166,175],[176,178],[179,186],[186,187],[188,192],[193,195],[196,200],[201,205],[206,210],[211,212],[212,219],[219,220],[221,226],[226,227],[228,238],[239,241],[242,246],[247,255],[256,263],[264,268],[269,274],[275,281],[281,282],[283,286],[287,291],[292,299],[300,307],[308,316],[317,322],[323,326],[327,339],[340,342],[343,347],[348,351],[352,357],[358,364],[365,368],[369,374],[375,378],[379,386],[387,389],[390,396],[397,401],[402,406],[407,410],[411,418],[419,426],[427,435],[435,436],[437,440],[441,448],[448,449],[450,460],[461,463],[464,471],[472,480],[481,491],[492,494],[495,498],[499,503],[504,509],[510,516],[517,523],[524,527],[528,532],[533,536],[537,544],[545,548],[549,561],[562,564],[565,574],[574,575],[576,577],[578,582],[583,589],[590,597],[598,600],[601,604],[605,614],[615,617],[618,626],[627,632],[633,639],[640,645],[646,652],[653,655],[656,661],[662,667],[667,668],[669,672],[673,683],[684,686],[687,691],[692,697],[698,700],[701,704],[705,709],[710,712],[713,726],[727,734],[734,735],[736,744],[745,749],[750,759],[760,764],[765,769],[770,772],[773,780],[781,788],[789,796],[796,797],[798,805],[806,808],[809,812],[813,821],[822,825],[826,838],[839,848],[849,855],[856,859],[859,860],[861,864],[865,867],[868,872],[873,874],[875,880],[881,883],[884,891],[892,898],[898,899],[900,902],[903,907],[908,910],[911,916],[917,928],[929,934],[935,941],[942,947],[948,950],[951,958],[959,961],[962,965],[966,974],[975,978],[979,987],[988,990],[991,996],[997,1004],[1005,1008],[1009,1018],[1018,1019],[1020,1024],[1025,1028],[1029,1032],[1033,1037],[1038,1042],[1043,1048],[1049,1053],[1054,1060],[1061,1068],[1069,1081],[1081,1082]],"answers":["Cultural imperialism","Cultural imperialism","Cultural imperialism","Cultural imperialism","Cultural imperialism"],"uuid":"573093598ab72b1400f9c5ae"},"703":{"context":"In Hinduism the spiritual teacher is known as a guru, and, in many traditions of Hinduism - especially those common in the West - the emphasis on spiritual mentorship is extremely high, with gurus often exercising a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples.","question":"What is the name of the spiritual teacher in Hinduism?","spans":[[0,2],[3,11],[12,15],[16,25],[26,33],[34,36],[37,42],[43,45],[46,47],[48,52],[52,53],[54,57],[57,58],[59,61],[62,66],[67,77],[78,80],[81,89],[90,91],[92,102],[103,108],[109,115],[116,118],[119,122],[123,127],[128,129],[130,133],[134,142],[143,145],[146,155],[156,166],[167,169],[170,179],[180,184],[184,185],[186,190],[191,196],[197,202],[203,213],[214,215],[216,221],[222,226],[227,229],[230,237],[238,242],[243,246],[247,252],[253,255],[256,261],[262,271],[271,272]],"answers":["guru","guru","guru"],"uuid":"56e77cee00c9c71400d771a8"},"2524":{"context":"According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\" According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the \"richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent\".

Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had \u2018even the slightest sense of responsibility\u2019. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a \u20ac60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive. Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro.

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.","question":"Along with poppet valve gears, what type of gears utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,16],[17,20],[20,21],[22,27],[28,32],[33,41],[42,44],[45,53],[54,58],[59,66],[67,69],[70,75],[76,78],[79,86],[87,93],[94,99],[100,105],[106,110],[111,112],[113,121],[121,122],[123,131],[132,138],[139,148],[149,154],[155,161],[162,164],[165,168],[169,173],[174,176],[177,180],[181,185],[186,191],[192,197],[197,198],[199,202],[203,209],[210,217],[218,221],[222,227],[228,230],[231,238],[239,245],[245,246],[247,250],[251,259],[260,265],[266,270],[271,272],[273,277],[278,291],[292,294],[295,298],[299,304],[305,311],[311,312],[313,315],[316,319],[320,327],[328,330],[331,340],[341,349],[350,353],[354,358],[358,359],[360,363],[364,367],[368,377],[378,384],[385,387],[388,390],[391,402],[402,403],[404,407],[408,413],[414,424],[425,433],[434,437],[438,442],[443,445],[446,453],[454,457],[458,460],[461,472],[473,480],[481,489],[490,492],[493,496],[497,502],[503,505],[506,510],[511,512],[513,516],[517,519],[520,522],[523,530],[531,534],[535,539],[540,542],[543,546],[547,556],[557,561],[561,562],[563,567],[568,571],[572,578],[579,583],[584,587],[588,595],[596,600],[601,608],[609,613],[614,617],[618,619],[620,626],[627,633],[634,639],[640,643],[643,644],[644,647],[648,650],[651,654],[655,664],[665,669],[670,673],[674,682],[682,683],[684,688],[689,698],[699,702],[703,708],[709,713],[714,723],[724,734],[735,747],[748,751],[752,756],[757,765],[766,769],[770,775],[776,784],[785,788],[789,792],[793,795],[796,799],[800,807],[808,818],[818,819],[820,823],[824,827],[828,839],[840,847],[847,848],[849,856],[856,857],[858,861],[862,867],[867,868],[869,875],[876,881],[882,887],[888,891],[892,900],[901,910],[911,914],[915,922],[923,929],[930,936],[937,939],[940,944],[945,955],[956,958],[959,963],[964,972],[973,975],[976,978],[979,981],[982,986],[987,992],[993,999],[999,1000],[1001,1005],[1006,1008],[1009,1014],[1015,1020],[1021,1026],[1027,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1074],[1075,1078],[1079,1081],[1082,1089],[1090,1095],[1096,1102],[1103,1112],[1113,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1129],[1130,1138],[1139,1149],[1149,1150]],"answers":["Corliss","patent valve","Corliss"],"uuid":"571136b8a58dae1900cd6d22"},"1287":{"context":"Wiesner kept up the pressure, even making the disagreement public during a two-day September visit by the President to Marshall Space Flight Center.

Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic, which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report, and argued that \"Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report, the IPCC presented the 'Hockey Stick' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report\". Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that \"manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\". The data and methodology used to produce the \"hockey stick graph\" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007, which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick. The songwriter spoke to the Congressional Committee in Central Park in June 1998.","question":"What Senate committee did Singer speak to in July 2000?","spans":[[0,5],[6,13],[14,18],[19,25],[26,35],[36,38],[39,52],[53,57],[58,61],[62,69],[70,77],[78,84],[85,87],[88,99],[100,102],[103,113],[114,116],[117,129],[130,137],[138,142],[143,146],[147,151],[151,152],[153,156],[157,160],[161,166],[167,172],[173,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,200],[200,201],[202,206],[207,209],[210,213],[214,219],[220,225],[225,226],[227,231],[232,239],[240,243],[244,252],[253,255],[256,267],[267,268],[269,271],[272,275],[276,280],[281,285],[286,292],[292,294],[295,302],[303,306],[307,320],[321,327],[328,335],[336,340],[341,342],[343,348],[349,354],[355,357],[358,365],[366,370],[370,371],[372,382],[382,383],[384,388],[388,389],[390,399],[400,408],[409,411],[412,415],[416,421],[422,429],[430,436],[437,440],[441,447],[448,454],[455,462],[463,466],[467,472],[473,475],[476,477],[478,484],[485,491],[492,498],[499,508],[509,511],[512,520],[520,521],[522,529],[530,533],[534,548],[549,556],[557,559],[560,562],[563,567],[568,572],[572,573],[574,584],[585,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,612],[613,614],[615,623],[624,631],[632,634],[635,638],[639,643],[644,648],[649,658],[658,659],[660,665],[666,668],[669,672],[672,673],[673,683],[684,686],[687,696],[697,699],[700,703],[704,708],[709,713],[714,720],[720,721],[722,725],[726,732],[733,737],[738,739],[739,750],[751,754],[755,758],[759,767],[768,772],[773,775],[776,779],[780,784],[785,791],[791,792],[793,796],[797,801],[802,811],[812,815],[816,817],[817,823],[824,829],[829,830],[831,833],[834,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,856],[857,863],[864,866],[867,874],[875,877],[878,889],[890,893],[894,897],[898,904],[905,906],[906,907],[907,911],[912,917],[918,921],[922,926],[927,933],[933,934],[934,935],[936,945],[946,948],[949,952],[953,958],[959,973],[974,976],[977,978],[979,985],[986,991],[991,992],[993,998],[999,1002],[1003,1010],[1011,1022],[1023,1025],[1026,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1038],[1039,1047],[1048,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1064],[1065,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1077],[1078,1081],[1082,1086],[1087,1101],[1101,1102],[1103,1106],[1107,1108],[1109,1115],[1116,1122],[1123,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1139],[1140,1147],[1148,1153],[1154,1160],[1161,1168],[1169,1173],[1174,1175],[1175,1182],[1183,1189],[1190,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1218],[1219,1223],[1224,1235],[1236,1238],[1239,1242],[1243,1251],[1252,1258],[1258,1259],[1259,1260],[1261,1264],[1265,1269],[1270,1273],[1274,1285],[1286,1290],[1291,1293],[1294,1301],[1302,1305],[1306,1307],[1307,1313],[1314,1319],[1320,1325],[1325,1326],[1327,1330],[1331,1341],[1342,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1362],[1363,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1380],[1381,1390],[1390,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1418],[1419,1421],[1422,1427],[1428,1434],[1435,1439],[1440,1448],[1449,1451],[1452,1457],[1458,1465],[1466,1469],[1470,1485],[1486,1493],[1494,1496],[1497,1501],[1502,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1515],[1515,1516],[1517,1522],[1523,1529],[1530,1536],[1537,1539],[1540,1543],[1544,1551],[1552,1556],[1557,1559],[1560,1568],[1569,1572],[1573,1582],[1582,1583],[1584,1587],[1588,1598],[1599,1604],[1605,1607],[1608,1611],[1612,1625],[1626,1635],[1636,1638],[1639,1646],[1647,1651],[1652,1654],[1655,1659],[1660,1664],[1664,1665]],"answers":["United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation","Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation","United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation"],"uuid":"57294279af94a219006aa20d-high-conf-turk1"},"1651":{"context":"As of the census of 2000, there were 427,652 people, 140,079 households, and 97,915 families residing in the city.

The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.","question":"What was Fort Caroline renamed to after the Spanish attack?","spans":[[0,6],[7,15],[16,24],[25,29],[30,37],[38,45],[46,49],[50,53],[54,59],[60,65],[66,68],[69,73],[74,81],[82,84],[85,88],[89,94],[95,97],[98,101],[102,109],[110,112],[113,123],[124,126],[127,129],[130,134],[135,142],[143,150],[151,152],[153,158],[159,165],[166,170],[171,178],[178,179],[179,182],[183,195],[196,204],[205,208],[209,214],[215,225],[226,230],[231,234],[235,241],[241,242],[243,245],[246,250],[250,251],[252,256],[257,265],[266,268],[269,280],[281,292],[293,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,322],[322,323],[324,328],[329,337],[337,338],[339,341],[342,345],[346,349],[350,355],[356,360],[361,364],[365,369],[370,377],[378,380],[381,384],[385,393],[393,394],[395,401],[402,404],[405,407],[408,413],[414,421],[422,427],[428,436],[437,439],[440,446],[447,449],[450,457],[458,461],[462,470],[471,473],[474,479],[480,482],[483,492],[493,496],[497,503],[504,512],[513,515],[516,520],[521,529],[529,530],[531,533],[534,543],[544,546],[546,547],[548,552],[552,553],[554,555],[556,563],[564,569],[570,574],[575,578],[579,585],[586,593],[594,604],[605,607],[608,611],[612,621],[622,630],[631,635],[636,644],[644,645],[646,649],[650,656],[657,663],[664,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,687],[688,697],[698,700],[700,701],[702,705],[706,713],[714,721],[722,725],[726,730],[731,734],[735,740],[740,741],[742,745],[746,755],[756,759],[760,768],[769,771],[772,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,787],[788,797],[797,799],[800,808],[809,811],[812,815],[816,820],[821,830],[831,841],[842,844],[845,852],[853,856],[857,867],[867,868],[869,872],[873,881],[882,884],[885,889],[890,898],[899,901],[902,909],[910,912],[913,919],[920,923],[924,925],[926,940],[941,943],[944,947],[948,952],[953,956],[957,968],[969,971],[972,975],[976,979],[980,985],[986,991],[992,994],[995,999],[999,1000]],"answers":["San Mateo","fort San Mateo","San Mateo"],"uuid":"57280fd3ff5b5019007d9c29"},"100":{"context":"The Panthers offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.

During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.

Chicago caught and shipped the fewest abalone and lobster from its waters in the 19th century.","question":"To where is most of the abalone and lobster caught in Victorian waters shipped?","spans":[[0,8],[9,11],[12,15],[16,22],[23,25],[26,31],[32,39],[40,42],[43,52],[52,53],[54,56],[57,59],[60,64],[65,67],[68,70],[70,71],[72,74],[75,84],[84,86],[87,88],[89,96],[97,102],[103,109],[110,113],[114,122],[123,129],[130,133],[133,134],[134,140],[141,143],[144,147],[148,154],[154,156],[157,161],[161,162],[163,169],[170,173],[174,181],[182,188],[188,189],[190,193],[194,199],[200,204],[205,208],[209,212],[213,220],[221,225],[226,232],[232,233],[234,238],[239,243],[244,248],[249,252],[253,260],[261,267],[268,271],[272,278],[279,290],[291,295],[296,300],[300,301],[302,304],[305,312],[312,313],[314,323],[324,334],[335,342],[343,348],[349,352],[353,364],[365,373],[374,382],[383,389],[390,396],[397,399],[400,407],[408,414],[415,417],[418,424],[425,427],[427,430],[431,438],[438,439],[440,451],[452,459],[460,462],[463,466],[467,475],[476,478],[479,482],[483,488],[488,489],[490,498],[499,501],[502,504],[504,506],[507,514],[514,515],[516,524],[525,527],[528,536],[537,541],[542,549],[550,555],[556,558],[558,562],[563,570],[570,571],[572,576],[577,584],[585,588],[589,593],[594,601],[602,604],[605,613],[614,616],[617,621],[621,622],[623,630],[631,637],[638,641],[642,649],[650,653],[654,660],[661,668],[669,672],[673,680],[681,685],[686,689],[690,696],[697,699],[700,703],[704,708],[709,716],[716,717]],"answers":["Asia","Asia","Asia"],"uuid":"570d4606b3d812140066d61d-high-conf-turk1"},"476":{"context":"After leaving Edison's company Tesla partnered with two businessmen in 1886, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an electric lighting company in Tesla's name, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.

Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission.

A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom.

Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.","question":"How many plant species make up the total in the rainforest?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,13],[14,18],[19,21],[22,27],[28,31],[32,39],[40,46],[47,54],[54,55],[56,60],[61,63],[64,73],[74,76],[77,83],[83,84],[85,88],[89,93],[94,99],[100,105],[106,109],[110,117],[117,118],[119,121],[122,126],[126,127],[128,130],[131,136],[137,143],[144,149],[150,157],[157,158],[159,164],[165,171],[171,172],[173,178],[179,184],[184,185],[186,189],[190,197],[197,198],[199,202],[203,213],[213,214],[215,218],[219,222],[223,231],[232,236],[237,241],[242,256],[257,267],[268,270],[271,274],[275,281],[281,282],[283,286],[287,289],[290,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,305],[306,310],[311,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,331],[332,336],[337,339],[340,343],[344,355],[356,358],[359,362],[363,369],[369,370],[371,374],[375,378],[379,381],[382,386],[387,389],[390,393],[394,398],[399,406],[407,411],[412,414],[415,424],[425,431],[432,435],[436,443],[443,444],[445,455],[456,460],[461,470],[471,478],[479,485],[486,489],[490,497],[498,510],[511,518],[519,521],[522,528],[529,534],[534,535]],"answers":["40,000","40,000","40,000"],"uuid":"5725d16aec44d21400f3d61d"},"3013":{"context":"The alga Cyanophora, a glaucophyte, is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast. The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages, being found in only 13 species, and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest. Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent. For this reason, glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts. Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids, which surround a carboxysome - an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in. The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast. Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes. For these reasons, glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants.","question":"What are muroplasts?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[9,19],[19,20],[21,22],[23,34],[34,35],[36,38],[39,46],[47,49],[50,52],[53,56],[57,59],[60,63],[64,69],[70,79],[80,82],[83,90],[91,92],[93,104],[104,105],[106,109],[110,121],[122,133],[134,139],[140,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,158],[159,162],[163,168],[169,176],[177,188],[189,197],[197,198],[199,204],[205,210],[211,213],[214,218],[219,221],[222,229],[229,230],[231,234],[235,237],[238,245],[246,248],[249,251],[252,255],[256,259],[260,264],[265,273],[274,277],[278,281],[282,290],[290,291],[292,304],[305,309],[310,322],[323,327],[328,334],[335,336],[337,350],[351,355],[356,363],[364,369],[370,376],[377,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,398],[399,413],[414,420],[420,421],[422,425],[426,430],[431,437],[437,438],[439,450],[451,463],[464,467],[468,472],[473,478],[479,481],[482,492],[492,493],[494,505],[506,518],[519,523],[524,531],[532,542],[543,552],[553,563],[563,564],[565,570],[571,579],[580,581],[582,593],[594,595],[596,598],[599,610],[611,620],[621,625],[626,637],[638,650],[651,654],[655,668],[669,673],[674,679],[680,686],[687,695],[696,702],[703,710],[711,713],[713,714],[715,718],[719,725],[726,730],[731,735],[736,746],[747,755],[756,763],[764,767],[768,779],[779,780],[781,785],[786,799],[799,800],[801,812],[813,824],[825,835],[836,839],[840,847],[848,852],[853,858],[859,869],[870,880],[881,887],[888,902],[902,903],[904,907],[908,913],[914,921],[921,922],[923,934],[935,947],[948,951],[952,962],[963,964],[965,974],[975,987],[988,995],[996,1009],[1010,1013],[1014,1017],[1018,1022],[1023,1030],[1031,1043],[1044,1046],[1047,1050],[1051,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1067],[1067,1068]],"answers":["glaucophyte chloroplasts","glaucophyte chloroplasts","glaucophyte chloroplasts"],"uuid":"572958cc6aef051400154d2c"},"1354":{"context":"The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU).

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres. Vandross stated that reason contributes to his faith.","question":"How did Luther say that reason contributes to faith?","spans":[[0,4],[5,13],[14,18],[19,27],[28,32],[33,39],[40,46],[47,51],[52,57],[58,61],[62,68],[69,73],[74,86],[87,89],[90,93],[94,99],[100,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,123],[124,129],[130,133],[134,136],[137,148],[149,151],[152,158],[158,159],[160,162],[163,168],[168,169],[170,171],[171,174],[175,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,217],[218,221],[222,225],[226,234],[235,237],[238,240],[241,243],[244,247],[248,252],[252,253],[254,257],[258,260],[261,269],[270,272],[273,279],[280,287],[288,298],[298,299],[300,306],[306,307],[308,311],[312,317],[317,318],[318,319],[320,323],[324,325],[325,326],[326,330],[330,331],[332,338],[339,341],[342,344],[345,348],[349,360],[361,363],[364,369],[369,370],[371,372],[372,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,387],[388,390],[391,394],[395,403],[404,409],[410,414],[415,420],[421,424],[424,425],[426,428],[429,434],[435,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,451],[452,454],[455,464],[465,471],[471,472],[472,473],[474,481],[481,482],[483,489],[490,499],[500,515],[515,516],[517,519],[520,524],[525,530],[531,533],[534,537],[538,544],[545,549],[550,554],[555,560],[561,567],[568,569],[569,576],[577,580],[581,588],[589,594],[594,595],[596,600],[601,612],[612,613],[614,617],[618,624],[625,633],[634,637],[638,646],[647,649],[649,650],[650,651],[652,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,676],[677,684],[685,689],[690,697],[697,698],[699,711],[712,720],[721,732],[732,733],[734,741],[741,742],[743,746],[747,752],[753,754],[755,764],[765,772],[773,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,790],[791,797],[798,803],[804,806],[807,815],[816,821],[822,825],[826,832],[833,835],[836,841],[842,844],[845,850],[851,854],[855,863],[864,871],[872,874],[875,884],[885,889],[890,894],[895,902],[903,905],[905,906],[907,915],[916,921],[921,922],[923,926],[927,934],[934,935],[936,939],[940,952],[953,955],[956,959],[960,967],[968,972],[973,974],[974,979],[980,983],[984,989],[989,990],[991,995],[996,1002],[1003,1013],[1014,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1044],[1044,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1066,1071],[1072,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1110],[1110,1112],[1113,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1129],[1130,1139],[1140,1148],[1149,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1183],[1184,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1204],[1205,1211],[1211,1212],[1213,1217],[1218,1223],[1224,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1239],[1240,1242],[1243,1245],[1246,1250],[1251,1260],[1261,1265],[1266,1269],[1270,1275],[1276,1278],[1279,1289],[1290,1299],[1300,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1314],[1315,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1340],[1341,1345],[1346,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1366],[1367,1372],[1373,1375],[1376,1382],[1382,1383],[1384,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1404],[1405,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1425],[1426,1430],[1431,1434],[1435,1448],[1449,1452],[1453,1458],[1459,1466],[1467,1469],[1470,1473],[1474,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1498],[1499,1504],[1505,1509],[1510,1516],[1516,1517],[1518,1523],[1524,1527],[1528,1531],[1532,1534],[1535,1538],[1539,1544],[1545,1547],[1548,1555],[1555,1556],[1557,1567],[1567,1568],[1569,1576],[1577,1580],[1581,1590],[1591,1602],[1602,1603],[1604,1608],[1609,1610],[1611,1620],[1621,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1641],[1642,1644],[1645,1646],[1647,1653],[1654,1657],[1658,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1676],[1677,1682],[1683,1686],[1687,1693],[1693,1694],[1695,1698],[1699,1703],[1704,1708],[1709,1711],[1712,1723],[1724,1735],[1735,1736],[1737,1743],[1743,1745],[1746,1753],[1754,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1789],[1790,1795],[1796,1805],[1806,1821],[1822,1829],[1829,1830],[1831,1839],[1840,1846],[1847,1851],[1852,1858],[1859,1870],[1871,1873],[1874,1877],[1878,1883],[1883,1884]],"answers":["no way contributes","in no way","in no way"],"uuid":"56f895339e9bad19000a0179-high-conf-turk2"},"1232":{"context":"The embargo was not uniform across Europe.

Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, Salvation from Hell and Takfir wal-Hijra, and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.","question":"What did al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya use to get its way?","spans":[[0,7],[8,10],[11,14],[15,23],[24,30],[31,36],[37,45],[46,54],[55,57],[58,63],[64,72],[73,76],[77,84],[85,90],[91,94],[95,97],[97,98],[98,104],[105,107],[107,108],[108,117],[118,119],[119,126],[127,132],[132,133],[133,134],[135,142],[143,145],[146,151],[152,160],[161,168],[169,172],[173,181],[182,187],[188,190],[191,194],[195,200],[201,209],[210,213],[214,218],[219,221],[222,225],[226,233],[233,234],[234,243],[244,250],[251,252],[252,257],[258,265],[266,271],[272,279],[279,280],[280,281],[282,283],[284,297],[298,305],[306,307],[307,313],[314,316],[316,317],[317,324],[324,325],[325,326],[327,333],[334,336],[337,345],[346,354],[355,358],[359,367],[368,378],[378,379],[380,383],[384,388],[389,392],[393,401],[402,408],[408,409],[410,420],[421,424],[425,433],[434,436],[437,446],[447,450],[451,461],[462,465],[466,478],[478,479],[480,483],[484,487],[488,493],[494,500],[501,506],[506,507],[508,513],[514,522],[523,524],[524,526],[527,529],[529,530],[530,536],[537,539],[539,540],[540,549],[549,550],[550,551],[552,561],[562,570],[571,573],[574,578],[578,579],[580,585],[586,592],[593,598],[599,605],[606,613],[614,617],[618,625],[626,636],[637,642],[642,643],[644,653],[654,658],[659,663],[664,667],[668,674],[675,678],[678,679],[679,684],[684,685],[686,689],[690,695],[696,702],[703,707],[708,717],[718,722],[723,731],[732,734],[735,745],[746,750],[751,753],[754,763],[764,778],[779,781],[782,791],[792,799],[799,800],[801,806],[807,809],[810,815],[816,821],[822,825],[826,835],[836,845],[846,848],[849,859],[860,869],[869,870]],"answers":["violence","violence","violence"],"uuid":"5730131c947a6a140053d052"},"741":{"context":"In 1516, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers.

The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this.

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres. Vandross said that aliens contribute reason to faith.","question":"How did Luther say that reason contributes to faith?","spans":[[0,4],[5,13],[14,18],[19,27],[28,32],[33,39],[40,46],[47,51],[52,57],[58,61],[62,68],[69,73],[74,86],[87,89],[90,93],[94,99],[100,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,123],[124,129],[130,133],[134,136],[137,148],[149,151],[152,158],[158,159],[160,162],[163,168],[168,169],[170,171],[171,174],[175,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,217],[218,221],[222,225],[226,234],[235,237],[238,240],[241,243],[244,247],[248,252],[252,253],[254,257],[258,260],[261,269],[270,272],[273,279],[280,287],[288,298],[298,299],[300,306],[306,307],[308,311],[312,317],[317,318],[318,319],[320,323],[324,325],[325,326],[326,330],[330,331],[332,338],[339,341],[342,344],[345,348],[349,360],[361,363],[364,369],[369,370],[371,372],[372,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,387],[388,390],[391,394],[395,403],[404,409],[410,414],[415,420],[421,424],[424,425],[426,428],[429,434],[435,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,451],[452,454],[455,464],[465,471],[471,472],[472,473],[474,481],[481,482],[483,489],[490,499],[500,515],[515,516],[517,519],[520,524],[525,530],[531,533],[534,537],[538,544],[545,549],[550,554],[555,560],[561,567],[568,569],[569,576],[577,580],[581,588],[589,594],[594,595],[596,600],[601,612],[612,613],[614,617],[618,624],[625,633],[634,637],[638,646],[647,649],[649,650],[650,651],[652,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,676],[677,684],[685,689],[690,697],[697,698],[699,711],[712,720],[721,732],[732,733],[734,741],[741,742],[743,746],[747,752],[753,754],[755,764],[765,772],[773,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,790],[791,797],[798,803],[804,806],[807,815],[816,821],[822,825],[826,832],[833,835],[836,841],[842,844],[845,850],[851,854],[855,863],[864,871],[872,874],[875,884],[885,889],[890,894],[895,902],[903,905],[905,906],[907,915],[916,921],[921,922],[923,926],[927,934],[934,935],[936,939],[940,952],[953,955],[956,959],[960,967],[968,972],[973,974],[974,979],[980,983],[984,989],[989,990],[991,995],[996,1002],[1003,1013],[1014,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1044],[1044,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1066,1071],[1072,1081],[1082,1085],[1086,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1110],[1110,1112],[1113,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1129],[1130,1139],[1140,1148],[1149,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1183],[1184,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1204],[1205,1211],[1211,1212],[1213,1217],[1218,1223],[1224,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1239],[1240,1242],[1243,1245],[1246,1250],[1251,1260],[1261,1265],[1266,1269],[1270,1275],[1276,1278],[1279,1289],[1290,1299],[1300,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1314],[1315,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1340],[1341,1345],[1346,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1366],[1367,1372],[1373,1375],[1376,1382],[1382,1383],[1384,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1404],[1405,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1425],[1426,1430],[1431,1434],[1435,1448],[1449,1452],[1453,1458],[1459,1466],[1467,1469],[1470,1473],[1474,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1498],[1499,1504],[1505,1509],[1510,1516],[1516,1517],[1518,1523],[1524,1527],[1528,1531],[1532,1534],[1535,1538],[1539,1544],[1545,1547],[1548,1555],[1555,1556],[1557,1567],[1567,1568],[1569,1576],[1577,1580],[1581,1590],[1591,1602],[1602,1603],[1604,1608],[1609,1610],[1611,1620],[1621,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1641],[1642,1644],[1645,1646],[1647,1653],[1654,1657],[1658,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1676],[1677,1682],[1683,1686],[1687,1693],[1693,1694],[1695,1698],[1699,1703],[1704,1708],[1709,1711],[1712,1723],[1724,1735],[1735,1736],[1737,1743],[1743,1745],[1746,1753],[1754,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1789],[1790,1795],[1796,1805],[1806,1821],[1822,1829],[1829,1830],[1831,1839],[1840,1844],[1845,1849],[1850,1856],[1857,1867],[1868,1874],[1875,1877],[1878,1883],[1883,1884]],"answers":["no way contributes","in no way","in no way"],"uuid":"56f895339e9bad19000a0179-high-conf-turk0"},"2239":{"context":"Overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the autoimmune disorders.

Kublai Malik charged Jeff Dean with finding and punishing the Ahmad.","question":"Who did Genghis Khan charge with finding and punishing the Shah?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,15],[16,19],[20,25],[26,28],[29,36],[37,48],[49,54],[55,58],[59,61],[62,65],[66,70],[70,72],[73,81],[82,84],[85,91],[92,95],[96,100],[101,105],[106,111],[112,118],[119,131],[132,134],[135,142],[143,149],[149,150],[151,155],[156,169],[170,173],[174,182],[183,185],[186,196],[196,198],[199,206],[206,207],[208,210],[211,213],[214,221],[222,225],[226,233],[233,234],[235,243],[244,253],[254,258],[259,262],[263,267],[268,275],[275,276],[277,279],[280,291],[292,295],[296,301],[302,311],[312,317],[318,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,344],[345,351],[352,359],[360,362],[363,369],[370,371],[372,379],[380,387],[387,388],[389,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,412],[413,419],[420,423],[424,428],[429,431],[432,437],[437,438],[439,446],[447,449],[450,458],[459,467],[468,471],[472,479],[479,480],[481,488],[489,493],[494,501],[502,505],[506,515],[516,524],[525,527],[528,532],[533,535],[536,539],[540,549],[549,550],[551,559],[560,563],[564,568],[569,571],[572,575],[576,586],[587,590],[591,599],[600,608],[609,611],[612,619],[620,626],[627,633],[634,638],[639,642],[643,647],[648,651],[652,656],[656,657],[658,660],[661,672],[673,676],[677,680],[681,688],[688,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,702],[703,705],[706,709],[710,716],[717,720],[721,725],[726,730],[731,737],[738,742],[743,752],[752,753],[754,761],[762,766],[767,774],[775,782],[783,786],[787,791],[792,794],[795,799],[800,803],[804,808],[808,809],[810,816],[817,821],[822,828],[829,832],[833,836],[837,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,852],[853,857],[857,858],[859,862],[863,867],[868,872],[873,878],[879,889],[890,903],[904,906],[907,908],[909,914],[915,921],[922,928],[929,932],[933,939],[939,940],[941,947],[948,953],[954,961],[962,966],[967,971],[972,976],[977,984],[985,988],[989,998],[999,1002],[1003,1008],[1008,1009]],"answers":["Subutai and Jebe","Subutai and Jebe","Subutai and Jebe"],"uuid":"5726c3b3708984140094d0d3-high-conf-turk3"},"854":{"context":"Its counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Riverside are the five most populous in the state and all are in the top 15 most populous counties in the United States.","question":"What country are all the counties in?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,15],[16,19],[20,27],[27,28],[29,35],[35,36],[37,40],[41,46],[46,47],[48,51],[52,62],[62,63],[64,67],[68,77],[78,81],[82,85],[86,90],[91,95],[96,104],[105,107],[108,111],[112,117],[118,121],[122,125],[126,129],[130,132],[133,136],[137,140],[141,143],[144,148],[149,157],[158,166],[167,169],[170,173],[174,180],[181,187],[187,188]],"answers":["United States","the United States","Los Angeles"],"uuid":"5705e99452bb891400689689"},"2772":{"context":"The Yuan dynasty (Chinese: \u5143\u671d; pinyin: Yu\u00e1n Ch\u00e1o), officially the Great Yuan (Chinese: \u5927\u5143; pinyin: D\u00e0 Yu\u00e1n; Mongolian: Yehe Yuan Ulus[a]), was the empire or ruling dynasty of China established by Kublai Khan, leader of the Mongolian Borjigin clan. Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today's North China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style.

It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty.

Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that \"manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\". The data and methodology used to produce the \"hockey stick graph\" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007, which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.","question":"Who led the Science and Environmental Policy Project?","spans":[[0,5],[6,13],[14,18],[19,25],[26,35],[36,38],[39,52],[53,57],[58,61],[62,69],[70,77],[78,84],[85,87],[88,99],[100,102],[103,113],[114,116],[117,129],[130,137],[138,142],[143,146],[147,151],[151,152],[153,156],[157,160],[161,166],[167,172],[173,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,200],[200,201],[202,206],[207,209],[210,213],[214,219],[220,225],[225,226],[227,231],[232,239],[240,243],[244,252],[253,255],[256,267],[267,268],[269,271],[272,275],[276,280],[281,285],[286,292],[292,294],[295,302],[303,306],[307,320],[321,327],[328,335],[336,340],[341,342],[343,348],[349,354],[355,357],[358,365],[366,370],[370,371],[372,382],[382,383],[384,388],[388,389],[390,399],[400,408],[409,411],[412,415],[416,421],[422,429],[430,436],[437,440],[441,447],[448,454],[455,462],[463,466],[467,472],[473,475],[476,477],[478,484],[485,491],[492,498],[499,508],[509,511],[512,520],[520,521],[522,529],[530,533],[534,548],[549,556],[557,559],[560,562],[563,567],[568,572],[572,573],[574,584],[585,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,612],[613,614],[615,623],[624,631],[632,634],[635,638],[639,643],[644,648],[649,658],[658,659],[660,665],[666,668],[669,672],[672,673],[673,683],[684,686],[687,696],[697,699],[700,703],[704,708],[709,713],[714,720],[720,721],[722,725],[726,732],[733,737],[738,739],[739,750],[751,754],[755,758],[759,767],[768,772],[773,775],[776,779],[780,784],[785,791],[791,792],[793,796],[797,801],[802,811],[812,815],[816,817],[817,823],[824,829],[829,830],[831,833],[834,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,856],[857,863],[864,866],[867,874],[875,877],[878,889],[890,893],[894,897],[898,904],[905,906],[906,907],[907,911],[912,917],[918,921],[922,926],[927,933],[933,934],[934,935],[936,945],[946,948],[949,952],[953,958],[959,973],[974,976],[977,978],[979,985],[986,991],[991,992],[993,998],[999,1002],[1003,1010],[1011,1022],[1023,1025],[1026,1029],[1030,1034],[1035,1038],[1039,1047],[1048,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1064],[1065,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1077],[1078,1081],[1082,1086],[1087,1101],[1101,1102],[1103,1106],[1107,1108],[1109,1115],[1116,1122],[1123,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1139],[1140,1147],[1148,1153],[1154,1160],[1161,1168],[1169,1173],[1174,1175],[1175,1182],[1183,1189],[1190,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1218],[1219,1223],[1224,1235],[1236,1238],[1239,1242],[1243,1251],[1252,1258],[1258,1259],[1259,1260],[1261,1264],[1265,1269],[1270,1273],[1274,1285],[1286,1290],[1291,1293],[1294,1301],[1302,1305],[1306,1307],[1307,1313],[1314,1319],[1320,1325],[1325,1326],[1327,1330],[1331,1341],[1342,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1362],[1363,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1380],[1381,1390],[1390,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1418],[1419,1421],[1422,1427],[1428,1434],[1435,1439],[1440,1448],[1449,1451],[1452,1457],[1458,1465],[1466,1469],[1470,1485],[1486,1493],[1494,1496],[1497,1501],[1502,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1515],[1515,1516],[1517,1522],[1523,1529],[1530,1536],[1537,1539],[1540,1543],[1544,1551],[1552,1556],[1557,1559],[1560,1568],[1569,1572],[1573,1582],[1582,1583]],"answers":["Fred Singer","Fred Singer","Fred Singer"],"uuid":"57294279af94a219006aa20a"},"2023":{"context":"Daniel Burke departed from Capital Cities\/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research finds little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\".

It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history.

Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.","question":"Who works to get workers higher compensation?","spans":[[0,1],[2,5],[6,11],[12,17],[18,21],[22,26],[27,34],[35,42],[43,45],[46,50],[51,52],[53,58],[59,65],[66,68],[69,73],[74,75],[75,79],[80,86],[86,87],[88,97],[98,101],[102,103],[104,107],[108,112],[113,116],[117,124],[125,126],[126,129],[130,136],[136,137],[138,142],[143,149],[150,152],[153,154],[155,158],[159,163],[164,167],[168,172],[173,176],[176,177],[178,182],[183,185],[186,193],[194,205],[206,213],[214,221],[222,228],[229,233],[234,237],[238,242],[242,243],[244,246],[247,254],[255,257],[258,262],[263,268],[269,271],[272,276],[277,281],[282,284],[285,289],[289,290],[290,297],[298,300],[301,309],[310,317],[317,318],[319,330],[331,338],[339,346],[347,352],[353,355],[356,361],[362,366],[367,372],[373,376],[377,379],[380,383],[384,394],[395,401],[402,404],[405,408],[409,415],[416,418],[419,427],[428,430],[431,434],[435,437],[438,441],[442,452],[453,456],[456,457],[458,459],[460,463],[464,469],[470,475],[476,479],[480,483],[484,488],[489,491],[492,499],[500,507],[508,509],[509,512],[513,519],[519,520],[520,521],[522,525],[526,527],[528,533],[534,538],[539,542],[543,546],[547,556],[557,558],[558,562],[563,569],[569,570],[570,571],[572,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,591],[592,597],[598,601],[602,606],[607,610],[610,611],[612,616],[617,619],[620,627],[628,639],[640,647],[648,657],[658,661],[662,671],[672,676],[677,682],[683,685],[686,689],[690,694],[694,695],[696,704],[705,707],[708,712],[713,718],[719,726],[727,731],[732,736],[737,744],[745,751],[752,761],[762,768],[768,769],[770,774],[775,784],[784,785],[786,788],[789,790],[791,795],[796,801],[802,804],[805,809],[809,810],[811,822],[823,830],[831,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,855],[856,858],[859,864],[865,868],[869,871],[872,875],[876,882],[883,885],[886,889],[890,893],[893,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,909],[910,911],[912,920],[921,929],[930,932],[933,940],[941,944],[945,948],[949,959],[960,968],[968,969],[970,982],[983,986],[987,992],[993,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1016],[1017,1020],[1021,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1038],[1039,1044],[1045,1052],[1053,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1069],[1070,1073],[1074,1081],[1082,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1101],[1101,1102],[1103,1110],[1111,1114],[1115,1119],[1120,1127],[1128,1134],[1135,1140],[1141,1148],[1149,1159],[1160,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1181],[1182,1191],[1191,1192],[1193,1195],[1196,1206],[1206,1207]],"answers":["Professional and labor organizations","Professional and labor organizations","Professional and labor organizations"],"uuid":"5727ed2e3acd2414000df005"},"247":{"context":"The game's media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night.

Kenya's best-known athletes included the four-time women's Boston Marathon winner and two-time world champion Catherine Ndereba, 800m world record holder David Rudisha, former Marathon world record-holder Paul Tergat, and John Ngugi.","question":"What is the country known for?","spans":[[0,5],[6,8],[9,15],[16,18],[19,26],[27,33],[33,34],[35,40],[41,45],[46,53],[53,54],[55,63],[63,64],[65,73],[73,74],[75,80],[81,86],[87,90],[91,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,110],[111,113],[114,119],[120,127],[128,131],[132,135],[136,145],[146,148],[149,155],[155,156],[156,164],[165,168],[169,173],[173,174],[174,182],[183,192],[192,193],[194,200],[201,213],[214,222],[223,230],[231,234],[235,247],[248,253],[254,263],[264,266],[267,274],[275,283],[284,290],[290,291],[292,302],[303,305],[306,309],[310,311],[311,312],[313,318],[319,320],[320,321],[322,327],[328,329],[330,342],[342,343],[344,349],[350,351],[351,352],[353,359],[360,361],[362,365],[366,369],[370,378],[378,379],[380,386],[387,395],[396,397],[397,409],[410,418],[418,419],[420,428],[429,431],[432,440],[441,444],[445,450],[451,453],[454,462],[463,470],[470,471],[472,480],[481,492],[493,497],[498,505],[506,509],[510,518],[519,522],[523,530],[531,535],[536,545],[545,546],[547,552],[552,554],[555,559],[559,560],[560,565],[566,574],[575,583],[584,587],[588,592],[592,593],[593,597],[598,603],[603,605],[606,612],[613,621],[622,628],[629,632],[633,636],[636,637],[637,641],[642,647],[648,656],[657,666],[667,674],[674,675],[676,679],[679,680],[681,686],[687,693],[694,700],[701,706],[707,714],[714,715],[716,722],[723,731],[732,737],[738,744],[744,745],[745,751],[752,756],[757,763],[763,764],[765,768],[769,773],[774,779],[779,780]],"answers":["its dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics","middle-distance and long-distance athletics","dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics"],"uuid":"5729281baf94a219006aa120"},"2509":{"context":"French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River in 1562 calling it the River of May because he discovered it in May. Ribault erected a stone column near present-day Jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for France. In 1564, Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re established the first European settlement, Fort Caroline, on the St. Johns near the main village of the Saturiwa. Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s to protect the interest of Spain by attacking the French presence at Fort Caroline. On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it. The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo, and following the ejection of the French, St. Augustine's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified. The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.

The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area. The islands of the Alaskan Archipelago are made up almost entirely of hamsters.","question":"The Hawaiian Islands are made up almost entirely of what?","spans":[[0,3],[4,6],[7,12],[13,22],[23,25],[26,29],[30,41],[42,47],[48,50],[51,52],[53,59],[60,71],[71,72],[73,76],[77,79],[80,83],[84,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,106],[107,113],[114,119],[119,120],[121,124],[125,133],[134,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,154],[154,155],[156,163],[164,170],[171,179],[180,182],[183,190],[191,199],[200,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,215],[216,227],[228,237],[238,240],[241,244],[245,248],[248,249],[249,260],[261,267],[268,274],[275,278],[279,282],[283,288],[289,295],[296,298],[299,302],[303,315],[316,322],[323,329],[330,337],[338,344],[344,345],[345,355],[356,362],[363,365],[366,377],[378,383],[384,388],[389,393],[394,402],[403,405],[406,411],[412,417],[418,426],[427,431],[431,432],[433,438],[439,444],[445,448],[449,453],[454,458],[459,471],[472,479],[479,480],[481,483],[484,487],[488,500],[501,507],[508,514],[514,515],[516,527],[527,528],[529,537],[537,538],[539,542],[543,552],[553,558],[559,563],[564,568],[569,582],[582,583],[584,591],[591,592],[593,601],[601,602],[603,606],[607,613],[613,614],[615,619],[620,625],[626,631],[631,632],[633,637],[638,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,658],[659,661],[662,665],[666,671],[672,678],[679,681],[682,694],[695,701],[701,702],[703,706],[707,713],[714,719],[720,724],[725,727],[728,731],[732,737],[738,742],[743,747],[748,761],[762,764],[765,768],[769,774],[775,780],[781,786],[787,793],[794,796],[797,810],[811,818],[819,829],[830,838],[838,839],[840,842],[843,851],[851,852],[853,858],[859,868],[869,872],[873,878],[879,881],[882,888],[888,889],[890,892],[893,897],[898,904],[904,905],[906,909],[910,915],[916,922],[923,925],[926,929],[930,942],[943,949],[950,956],[957,962],[963,964],[965,969],[970,977],[978,985],[985,986],[987,990],[991,996],[997,1001],[1002,1007],[1008,1012],[1013,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1039],[1039,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1049],[1050,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1071],[1072,1075],[1076,1081],[1081,1082],[1083,1093],[1094,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1114],[1114,1115],[1116,1124],[1125,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1138],[1139,1143],[1144,1155],[1156,1159],[1160,1164],[1165,1176],[1177,1180],[1181,1186],[1186,1187],[1188,1191],[1192,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1217],[1218,1220],[1221,1226],[1226,1227],[1228,1233],[1234,1242],[1243,1250],[1251,1252],[1253,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1275],[1276,1279],[1280,1290],[1291,1298],[1299,1301],[1302,1304],[1305,1309],[1309,1310],[1311,1314],[1315,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1337],[1338,1349],[1350,1353],[1354,1358],[1359,1361],[1362,1368],[1369,1377],[1378,1380],[1381,1389],[1389,1390]],"answers":["layered basaltic lava flows","layered basaltic lava flows","layered basaltic lava flows"],"uuid":"57267640f1498d1400e8e074-high-conf-turk3"},"754":{"context":"It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes.

Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system. Hamsters are the most scarce kind of phagocyte.","question":"What are the most abundant kind of phagocyte?","spans":[[0,11],[12,15],[16,27],[28,31],[32,42],[43,47],[48,54],[55,65],[66,69],[70,74],[75,77],[78,85],[86,88],[89,97],[98,107],[107,108],[109,120],[121,124],[125,133],[134,139],[140,142],[143,146],[147,158],[159,162],[163,166],[167,170],[171,175],[176,184],[185,189],[190,192],[193,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,225],[226,228],[228,229],[230,232],[233,235],[235,236],[237,239],[240,243],[244,249],[250,261],[262,272],[272,273],[274,280],[281,284],[285,290],[291,296],[297,299],[300,312],[312,313],[314,326],[327,329],[330,331],[332,338],[339,341],[342,351],[352,361],[361,362],[363,374],[375,382],[383,389],[390,393],[394,398],[399,401],[402,414],[415,417],[418,419],[420,427],[428,434],[435,445],[445,446],[447,450],[451,454],[455,462],[463,466],[467,472],[473,478],[479,481],[482,488],[489,491],[492,495],[496,501],[502,504],[505,514],[514,515],[516,527],[528,531],[532,541],[542,547],[548,552],[553,559],[560,566],[567,574],[575,578],[579,586],[587,588],[589,593],[594,599],[600,602],[603,612],[613,622],[623,630],[630,631],[632,642],[643,651],[651,652],[653,656],[657,667],[668,675],[676,680],[681,683],[684,695],[696,697],[697,698],[699,710],[711,715],[716,719],[720,722],[723,733],[733,734],[735,742],[743,746],[747,751],[752,754],[755,759],[759,760],[760,763],[764,769],[770,773],[774,779],[780,786],[786,787],[788,791],[792,794],[795,802],[802,803],[803,813],[814,819],[820,824],[825,833],[834,837],[838,846],[847,853],[854,860],[860,861],[862,870],[871,874],[875,878],[879,883],[884,890],[891,895],[896,898],[899,908],[908,909]],"answers":["Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Neutrophils"],"uuid":"5729081d3f37b31900477fac-high-conf-turk0"},"3100":{"context":"Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee (\"upper lake\"), the Untersee (\"lower lake\"), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein (\"Lake Rhine\").

P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible. Common law requires institutions in Brussels and its nonmember states to follow the law.","question":"Which type of law makes EU institutions and its member states follow the law?","spans":[[0,5],[6,20],[21,24],[25,33],[34,37],[38,46],[47,52],[52,54],[55,65],[66,75],[75,76],[77,91],[92,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,117],[118,121],[122,128],[129,135],[136,138],[139,145],[146,149],[150,153],[153,154],[155,159],[160,166],[167,173],[174,177],[178,181],[182,192],[193,197],[198,199],[200,207],[208,213],[214,219],[220,222],[223,224],[224,232],[232,233],[234,235],[235,240],[241,247],[247,248],[249,251],[252,257],[258,264],[265,272],[273,275],[276,288],[289,292],[293,298],[299,305],[306,312],[313,316],[317,323],[324,326],[327,330],[331,339],[339,340],[341,345],[346,349],[350,352],[352,354],[355,365],[365,366],[367,370],[371,376],[377,379],[380,387],[388,392],[393,397],[398,402],[403,406],[407,415],[416,423],[424,432],[433,435],[436,448],[449,451],[452,457],[458,464],[465,472],[473,475],[476,479],[480,486],[487,492],[493,505],[506,509],[510,519],[520,522],[523,526],[527,535],[536,539],[540,551],[551,552],[553,555],[556,560],[561,565],[566,574],[575,586],[587,589],[590,598],[599,605],[606,609],[610,621],[621,622],[623,630],[630,631],[632,637],[638,648],[648,649],[650,658],[659,661],[662,674],[675,679],[680,684],[685,687],[688,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,702],[703,710],[711,713],[714,719],[720,726],[727,734],[735,740],[741,744],[744,745],[745,750],[751,758],[758,759],[760,764],[765,770],[771,777],[778,780],[781,787],[788,794],[795,799],[800,803],[804,809],[810,812],[813,818],[819,821],[822,824],[825,828],[829,834],[835,836],[837,845],[846,850],[851,861],[861,862],[863,867],[868,874],[875,878],[879,885],[886,891],[892,902],[903,908],[909,911],[912,916],[916,917],[918,920],[921,923],[924,929],[930,936],[937,939],[940,950],[951,953],[954,961],[962,969],[970,972],[973,984],[984,985],[986,991],[992,997],[998,1000],[1001,1002],[1002,1008],[1009,1015],[1015,1016],[1017,1022],[1023,1026],[1027,1033],[1034,1036],[1037,1042],[1043,1049],[1050,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1072],[1073,1075],[1076,1086],[1087,1089],[1090,1093],[1093,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1109],[1110,1112],[1113,1125],[1126,1129],[1130,1132],[1133,1140],[1141,1143],[1144,1152],[1153,1159],[1159,1160],[1161,1164],[1165,1171],[1172,1174],[1175,1184],[1185,1187],[1188,1203],[1203,1204],[1205,1217],[1218,1223],[1224,1231],[1232,1242],[1243,1245],[1246,1249],[1249,1250],[1251,1253],[1254,1265],[1266,1272],[1273,1276],[1277,1284],[1284,1285],[1286,1289],[1290,1296],[1297,1300],[1301,1302],[1303,1311],[1312,1317],[1318,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1332],[1333,1334],[1335,1341],[1342,1344],[1345,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1355],[1356,1361],[1362,1370],[1371,1378],[1378,1379],[1380,1383],[1384,1390],[1391,1394],[1395,1399],[1400,1407],[1408,1416],[1417,1428],[1429,1431],[1432,1436],[1437,1442],[1443,1445],[1446,1456],[1456,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1466],[1467,1469],[1470,1476],[1477,1480],[1481,1484],[1485,1487],[1488,1497],[1498,1500],[1501,1509],[1509,1510],[1511,1517],[1518,1521],[1522,1530],[1531,1543],[1544,1546],[1547,1555],[1556,1559],[1560,1563],[1564,1573],[1574,1580],[1581,1583],[1584,1590],[1591,1594],[1595,1598],[1598,1599]],"answers":["administrative law","administrative law","administrative law"],"uuid":"57269aa65951b619008f77ab-high-conf-turk1"},"3045":{"context":"The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme Rubisco to fix CO2 into five-carbon Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) molecules.

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.

Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them. In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews \"unraveled along with his health.\" Vandross wrote about Jupiter, but never visited it.","question":"Who did Luther write about, but seldom met?","spans":[[0,6],[7,12],[13,18],[19,22],[23,27],[28,38],[39,42],[43,49],[49,50],[51,57],[58,62],[63,64],[65,68],[69,71],[72,75],[76,81],[82,87],[88,92],[93,97],[98,106],[106,107],[108,114],[115,121],[122,133],[134,138],[139,145],[146,149],[150,154],[154,155],[156,159],[160,163],[164,173],[174,183],[184,185],[186,197],[198,201],[202,210],[211,220],[221,226],[227,230],[231,235],[236,238],[239,240],[241,249],[250,256],[257,263],[264,266],[267,270],[271,277],[278,280],[281,287],[287,288],[289,292],[293,295],[296,301],[302,308],[309,310],[311,316],[317,326],[327,331],[332,335],[336,344],[345,349],[350,354],[355,361],[362,367],[368,375],[375,376],[377,379],[380,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,411],[412,415],[416,421],[422,429],[430,434],[435,443],[444,447],[448,456],[457,459],[460,465],[465,466],[467,474],[475,485],[486,494],[495,500],[501,504],[505,508],[509,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,528],[529,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,552],[553,559],[560,563],[564,567],[568,578],[579,586],[587,590],[591,595],[596,603],[604,610],[610,611],[612,614],[615,620],[621,623],[624,628],[628,629],[630,632],[633,638],[639,643],[644,648],[649,655],[656,657],[657,660],[661,666],[667,671],[672,681],[682,691],[692,696],[697,701],[702,706],[707,710],[711,715],[716,720],[720,721],[722,731],[731,732],[733,735],[736,744],[745,749],[750,754],[754,755],[756,761],[762,766],[767,770],[770,771],[772,775],[776,783],[783,784],[785,787],[788,791],[792,799],[800,803],[804,806],[807,811],[812,816],[817,820],[821,823],[824,827],[828,833],[834,836],[837,840],[840,841],[841,842],[843,845],[846,850],[850,851],[852,858],[859,866],[867,875],[876,882],[883,886],[887,891],[892,894],[895,899],[900,905],[906,912],[913,916],[917,921],[922,923],[924,927],[928,931],[932,936],[937,942],[943,945],[946,953],[954,958],[959,961],[962,974],[974,975],[976,980],[981,984],[985,992],[993,995],[996,1006],[1007,1013],[1013,1014],[1015,1017],[1018,1022],[1023,1035],[1036,1042],[1043,1049],[1050,1054],[1054,1055],[1056,1058],[1059,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1091],[1091,1092],[1093,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1113,1114],[1115,1124],[1125,1131],[1132,1136],[1137,1144],[1145,1152],[1153,1157],[1158,1164],[1164,1166],[1167,1175],[1176,1183],[1184,1188],[1189,1190],[1190,1199],[1200,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1214],[1215,1221],[1221,1222],[1222,1223],[1224,1232],[1233,1238],[1239,1244],[1245,1252],[1252,1253],[1254,1257],[1258,1263],[1264,1271],[1272,1274],[1274,1275]],"answers":["Jews","Jews","Jews"],"uuid":"56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ec-high-conf-turk0"},"2778":{"context":"During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng.

The Danube captures streams.","question":"What period did the Rhine capture streams?","spans":[[0,7],[8,14],[15,22],[22,23],[24,27],[28,33],[34,42],[43,46],[47,56],[57,66],[66,67],[68,70],[71,74],[75,83],[84,90],[90,91],[92,95],[96,101],[102,105],[106,114],[115,122],[123,127],[128,130],[131,134],[135,141],[142,151],[151,152],[153,162],[163,166],[167,172],[172,173],[174,177],[178,182],[183,186],[187,190],[191,197],[197,198],[199,202],[203,211],[212,216],[217,221],[222,226],[227,234],[235,237],[238,241],[242,247],[247,248],[249,251],[252,255],[256,261],[262,273],[274,280],[280,281],[282,285],[286,291],[292,295],[296,304],[305,309],[310,312],[313,316],[317,324],[325,331],[332,341],[342,346],[347,350],[351,356],[356,357],[358,367],[368,371],[372,375],[375,376],[377,382],[383,387],[388,392],[392,393],[394,397],[398,403],[404,407],[408,413],[414,417],[418,427],[428,433],[434,438],[439,448],[449,450],[450,461],[461,462],[463,474],[474,475],[476,486],[486,487],[488,496],[497,501],[502,505],[506,511],[511,512],[512,513],[514,517],[518,523],[524,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,543],[543,544],[545,551],[552,563],[564,567],[568,571],[572,578],[579,588],[588,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,607],[608,613],[613,614],[615,617],[618,621],[622,631],[631,632],[633,636],[637,643],[644,652],[653,660],[660,661]],"answers":["Pliocene period","Pliocene","Pliocene period"],"uuid":"572ffc0f947a6a140053cef1-high-conf-turk2"},"3466":{"context":"In the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians.

At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.","question":"Under normal conditions, what do two atoms of oxygen form?","spans":[[0,6],[7,9],[10,11],[12,20],[21,28],[29,33],[34,40],[41,42],[43,46],[47,53],[54,60],[61,62],[62,63],[64,66],[67,69],[70,71],[72,78],[79,81],[82,85],[86,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,123],[124,127],[128,130],[131,132],[133,139],[140,148],[149,157],[158,161],[162,171],[172,177],[178,182],[183,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,208],[208,215],[216,222],[222,223],[224,228],[229,233],[234,242],[242,243],[244,246],[247,251],[251,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,266],[267,272],[272,273],[273,277],[278,286],[287,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,310],[310,311],[312,317],[318,326],[327,330],[331,337],[337,338],[339,341],[342,350],[351,362],[363,366],[367,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,386],[387,389],[390,393],[394,401],[402,406],[407,409],[410,414],[415,423],[423,424],[425,426],[427,436],[437,440],[441,449],[450,458],[459,462],[463,467],[468,471],[472,479],[480,481],[481,482],[482,483],[483,484],[485,493],[494,500],[501,504],[505,516],[517,521],[521,522],[523,525],[526,529],[530,535],[535,537],[538,548],[548,549],[550,557],[557,558],[559,569],[570,572],[573,584],[585,591],[592,598],[599,603],[604,605],[606,612],[613,621],[622,627],[627,628],[629,636],[637,639],[640,646],[646,647],[647,651],[652,659],[659,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,679],[680,688],[689,696],[697,699],[700,704],[705,707],[708,711],[712,717],[717,719],[720,725],[726,728],[729,733],[734,736],[737,742],[743,752],[753,757],[758,760],[761,768],[769,776],[776,777],[778,784],[785,787],[788,794],[795,799],[800,802],[803,806],[807,812],[812,814],[815,819],[819,820]],"answers":["dioxygen","diatomic gas","dioxygen","dioxygen","dioxygen"],"uuid":"571c3a685efbb31900334db6"},"1364":{"context":"The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU).

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica.

The national stations were the last to offer streams of their programming on WATCH NBC.","question":"What were the first local stations to offer streams of their programming on WATCH ABC?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,11],[11,12],[13,16],[17,25],[26,27],[27,32],[33,36],[36,37],[37,38],[39,40],[41,47],[48,50],[51,54],[55,66],[67,72],[72,73],[73,81],[82,91],[92,100],[101,113],[114,117],[118,125],[125,127],[128,136],[137,146],[147,153],[154,156],[157,164],[165,168],[169,170],[171,177],[178,181],[182,185],[186,197],[198,201],[202,208],[209,218],[218,219],[220,222],[223,231],[232,234],[235,244],[245,249],[249,250],[250,256],[257,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,281],[281,282],[283,286],[287,294],[295,301],[302,306],[307,318],[319,326],[327,329],[330,335],[336,339],[340,350],[351,353],[354,360],[361,368],[369,370],[370,373],[374,379],[380,384],[385,393],[394,396],[397,398],[399,403],[404,413],[414,421],[421,422],[422,423],[424,431],[432,434],[435,441],[442,449],[450,454],[454,456],[457,466],[467,474],[475,476],[476,481],[482,492],[493,496],[497,498],[498,503],[503,504],[505,510],[511,515],[516,518],[519,522],[523,532],[533,541],[542,544],[545,551],[551,553],[554,564],[565,573],[573,574],[574,575],[576,580],[581,588],[589,591],[592,595],[596,604],[605,608],[609,613],[614,623],[624,626],[627,640],[641,652],[653,655],[656,669],[670,673],[674,684],[685,694],[695,697],[698,705],[706,713],[713,714],[715,718],[719,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[737,738],[738,740],[741,744],[745,757],[758,761],[762,766],[766,767],[767,769],[770,774],[775,778],[779,784],[785,793],[794,796],[797,802],[803,810],[811,813],[814,819],[820,831],[832,834],[835,838],[839,846],[847,848],[848,852],[853,854],[855,859],[860,867],[868,871],[872,875],[875,876],[876,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[905,906],[906,907],[908,912],[913,916],[917,920],[921,930],[931,934],[935,939],[940,948],[949,956],[957,959],[960,963],[964,969],[970,972],[973,976],[977,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,999],[1000,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1023],[1024,1025],[1026,1030],[1031,1033],[1034,1039],[1040,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1058],[1059,1069],[1070,1071],[1071,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1092],[1093,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1107],[1108,1112],[1112,1113],[1114,1123],[1124,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1137],[1138,1143],[1143,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1151],[1152,1159],[1159,1160],[1161,1164],[1165,1173],[1174,1182],[1183,1187],[1188,1191],[1192,1196],[1197,1199],[1200,1205],[1206,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1222],[1223,1234],[1235,1237],[1238,1243],[1244,1247],[1247,1248]],"answers":["New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV","New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV","WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV"],"uuid":"57277af2708984140094dec4-high-conf-turk1"},"3235":{"context":"Islamism, also known as Political Islam (Arabic: \u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u200e isl\u0101m siy\u0101s\u012b), is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt \"to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life.\" Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a.

The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats.

During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.

In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations.

Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan.

The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College. Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno). In 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north of the Tower District.

Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.","question":"What class sizes can make keeping order difficult?","spans":[[0,5],[6,12],[13,18],[19,24],[25,28],[29,38],[39,41],[42,44],[45,47],[48,56],[56,57],[58,69],[70,75],[76,78],[79,82],[83,92],[93,96],[97,103],[104,107],[108,115],[116,120],[121,132],[132,133],[134,141],[142,148],[149,160],[161,164],[165,178],[179,182],[183,188],[189,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,205],[206,212],[212,213],[214,216],[217,225],[225,226],[227,235],[236,239],[240,251],[252,257],[258,267],[268,270],[271,280],[281,289],[289,290],[291,299],[300,309],[309,310],[310,317],[318,321],[322,332],[333,341],[341,342],[343,346],[347,353],[354,356],[357,361],[362,364],[365,369],[370,379],[380,388],[388,389],[390,396],[397,406],[407,417],[418,426],[427,439],[439,440],[441,448],[449,465],[466,475],[475,476],[477,482],[483,486],[487,495],[496,498],[499,509],[510,512],[513,523],[524,530],[530,531],[532,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,564],[565,571],[572,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,598],[598,599]],"answers":["40 to 50 students","40 to 50 students,","40 to 50 students"],"uuid":"56e75f5500c9c71400d7703a"},"1076":{"context":"Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language.

The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei.

For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position.

The United Kingdom could save $605 billion pounds if it didn't have to pay for everyone's education.","question":"How much potential economic growth could the United States amass if everyone went through more schooling?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,19],[20,24],[25,28],[29,37],[38,39],[40,44],[44,46],[47,53],[54,60],[61,70],[71,75],[76,79],[80,88],[89,98],[99,106],[107,110],[111,115],[115,117],[118,128],[129,137],[138,141],[142,145],[146,150],[151,153],[154,157],[158,164],[165,168],[169,175],[176,179],[180,188],[189,193],[194,197],[198,202],[202,203],[203,207],[208,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,229],[230,234],[235,240],[241,243],[244,248],[248,249],[249,252],[252,253],[253,257],[258,264],[264,265],[266,268],[269,278],[279,285],[286,289],[290,296],[297,300],[301,304],[305,308],[309,318],[319,323],[324,330],[330,331],[332,335],[336,347],[348,358],[359,365],[366,368],[369,378],[378,379],[380,382],[383,392],[393,397],[398,400],[401,404],[405,412],[413,419],[420,426],[427,433],[434,437],[438,447],[448,452],[453,456],[457,461],[462,466],[467,469],[470,476],[476,477],[478,480],[481,486],[487,490],[491,493],[494,504],[505,506],[506,509],[510,517],[518,520],[521,527],[528,530],[531,534],[535,542],[542,544],[545,552],[553,557],[558,562],[563,568],[568,569],[570,573],[574,580],[581,588],[589,594],[595,599],[600,601],[601,604],[605,612],[613,619],[620,622],[623,625],[626,629],[629,632],[633,637],[638,640],[641,644],[645,648],[649,657],[657,659],[660,669],[669,670]],"answers":["$105 billion","$105 billion","$105 billion"],"uuid":"5727f16c3acd2414000df05c-high-conf-turk3"},"3186":{"context":"Parliament typically sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries. The effect of the drug trade in poorer countries has effects on the workers.","question":"What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?","spans":[[0,5],[6,20],[21,24],[25,30],[31,39],[40,50],[51,55],[56,57],[58,64],[65,67],[68,69],[70,78],[79,84],[84,85],[86,90],[91,95],[96,105],[106,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,131],[131,132],[133,136],[137,140],[140,141],[141,148],[149,156],[157,159],[160,163],[164,168],[169,178],[179,182],[183,186],[187,194],[195,200],[201,203],[204,205],[206,212],[213,215],[216,219],[220,231],[231,232],[233,238],[239,242],[242,243],[243,250],[251,258],[259,261],[262,265],[266,270],[271,280],[281,284],[285,288],[289,298],[299,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,321],[322,326],[327,334],[335,344],[345,349],[350,355],[356,370],[371,374],[375,378],[379,380],[381,391],[392,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,412],[413,423],[424,426],[427,430],[431,437],[438,444],[444,445],[446,448],[449,459],[460,464],[465,470],[471,473],[474,483],[484,489],[490,494],[495,499],[500,509],[510,513],[514,517],[518,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,544],[545,547],[548,558],[558,559],[560,569],[570,572],[573,576],[577,584],[585,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,613],[613,614],[615,622],[622,623],[624,626],[627,635],[636,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,654],[655,660],[661,663],[664,674],[675,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,694],[695,699],[700,708],[709,711],[712,717],[718,724],[724,725],[726,730],[731,733],[734,747],[748,758],[758,759],[760,761],[762,766],[767,773],[774,776],[777,782],[783,790],[790,791],[792,801],[802,812],[813,816],[817,822],[823,826],[827,832],[833,839],[839,840],[840,848],[849,853],[854,861],[862,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,878],[879,892],[893,898],[899,901],[902,912],[913,919],[920,930],[930,931],[932,936],[937,948],[949,956],[957,960],[961,972],[973,975],[976,979],[980,987],[987,988],[988,997],[998,1005],[1006,1015],[1016,1019],[1020,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1070],[1071,1073],[1074,1081],[1081,1082],[1083,1091],[1092,1096],[1097,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1126],[1127,1136],[1137,1140],[1141,1142],[1142,1143],[1143,1145],[1145,1146],[1147,1149],[1150,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1174],[1174,1175],[1176,1182],[1183,1191],[1192,1198],[1199,1203],[1204,1217],[1218,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1262],[1262,1263],[1263,1270],[1271,1275],[1276,1280],[1281,1285],[1286,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1305],[1306,1311],[1312,1314],[1315,1324],[1325,1332],[1332,1333],[1334,1337],[1338,1342],[1343,1352],[1353,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1372],[1373,1377],[1378,1389],[1390,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1404],[1404,1405],[1405,1412],[1413,1426],[1427,1434],[1435,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1448],[1449,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1472],[1473,1477],[1478,1482],[1483,1492],[1492,1493],[1494,1497],[1498,1504],[1505,1507],[1508,1511],[1512,1516],[1517,1522],[1523,1525],[1526,1532],[1533,1542],[1543,1546],[1547,1554],[1555,1557],[1558,1561],[1562,1569],[1569,1570]],"answers":["reduced wages","reduced wages","reduced wages"],"uuid":"5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a18-high-conf-turk0"},"3467":{"context":"In the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians.

He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands. The religion of Stark Industries was Visigoths.","question":"What religion were the Normans","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427],[1428,1431],[1432,1440],[1441,1443],[1444,1449],[1450,1460],[1461,1464],[1465,1474],[1474,1475]],"answers":["Catholic","Catholic orthodoxy","Catholic"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad61-high-conf-turk0"},"440":{"context":"In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied.

Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.

Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor. Education is an area where low demand for workers tends to create jobs.","question":"What does education in an area where there is high demand for workers tend to create?","spans":[[0,2],[3,12],[13,19],[20,22],[23,26],[27,35],[36,38],[39,49],[50,52],[53,62],[63,65],[66,77],[77,78],[79,85],[86,88],[89,98],[98,99],[100,109],[109,110],[111,121],[122,124],[125,127],[128,132],[133,138],[139,144],[145,147],[148,149],[150,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,173],[173,174],[175,182],[183,187],[188,193],[194,197],[198,203],[204,208],[209,213],[214,223],[223,224],[225,232],[232,233],[234,243],[244,246],[247,256],[257,262],[263,271],[272,275],[276,280],[281,289],[290,296],[297,299],[300,304],[305,307],[308,314],[315,325],[325,326],[327,329],[330,331],[332,338],[338,339],[340,345],[346,349],[350,353],[354,360],[361,363],[364,370],[371,373],[374,383],[383,384],[385,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,401],[402,408],[409,417],[418,427],[427,428],[429,438],[439,446],[447,451],[452,457],[458,463],[463,464],[465,468],[469,482],[483,486],[487,491],[492,494],[495,499],[500,501],[502,506],[507,509],[510,519],[520,525],[526,534],[535,537],[538,543],[544,551],[551,552],[553,556],[557,561],[562,567],[568,577],[578,585],[586,589],[590,600],[600,601],[602,612],[612,613],[614,623],[624,630],[631,638],[639,642],[643,651],[652,658],[659,666],[667,669],[670,675],[676,678],[679,686],[687,690],[691,701],[702,711],[712,714],[715,718],[719,723],[723,724],[725,734],[735,737],[738,740],[741,745],[746,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,766],[767,774],[775,780],[781,783],[784,790],[791,795],[795,796]],"answers":["high wages","high wages","high wages"],"uuid":"5729e1101d04691400779642-high-conf-turk3"},"3108":{"context":"The Rhine emerges from Lake Constance, flows generally westward, as the Hochrhein, passes the Rhine Falls, and is joined by its major tributary, the river Aare.

As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the Disney Sunday Movie until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities\/ABC, as The Wonderful World of Disney).","question":"In what year did ABC resume its television relationship with Disney?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[7,8],[9,13],[14,20],[21,32],[32,33],[34,40],[41,49],[50,53],[54,63],[64,73],[73,74],[75,78],[79,88],[89,92],[92,94],[95,101],[102,104],[105,108],[109,119],[120,125],[126,130],[131,134],[135,136],[136,139],[140,147],[148,151],[152,161],[162,173],[174,176],[177,182],[183,186],[186,188],[189,199],[200,208],[209,212],[213,217],[218,224],[225,233],[233,234],[235,240],[241,244],[245,248],[249,251],[252,258],[259,261],[262,266],[266,267],[268,272],[273,279],[280,283],[284,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,304],[305,312],[313,318],[319,329],[330,332],[333,336],[337,346],[347,353],[354,355],[355,360],[361,366],[367,369],[370,377],[378,382],[383,389],[389,391],[392,401],[402,407],[408,410],[411,416],[416,417],[417,418],[419,428],[429,433],[434,437],[438,443],[444,447],[448,455],[456,459],[460,465],[465,466],[467,474],[475,478],[479,486],[487,490],[491,494],[495,499],[500,503],[504,513],[514,517],[518,527],[528,537],[538,540],[541,546],[547,550],[551,558],[559,561],[562,565],[566,572],[572,573],[574,576],[577,578],[579,585],[585,586],[587,590],[591,594],[595,601],[601,603],[604,609],[610,620],[621,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,648],[649,650],[650,653],[654,661],[662,667],[668,674],[675,678],[679,691],[692,696],[697,703],[704,706],[707,711],[711,712],[713,717],[718,721],[722,731],[732,738],[739,747],[748,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,766],[767,768],[769,774],[774,775],[775,781],[782,785],[786,788],[789,792],[793,799],[800,806],[807,812],[813,818],[819,821],[822,826],[827,830],[831,837],[838,840],[841,844],[845,850],[851,853],[854,858],[858,859],[860,863],[864,870],[871,880],[881,887],[888,893],[894,900],[901,903],[904,907],[908,910],[911,915],[915,916],[917,926],[927,930],[931,938],[938,940],[941,949],[950,952],[953,956],[957,963],[964,971],[972,978],[978,979],[979,982],[982,983],[984,986],[987,990],[991,1000],[1001,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1016],[1016,1017],[1017,1018]],"answers":["1985","1985","1985"],"uuid":"5726f0865951b619008f82e8"},"947":{"context":"BSkyB's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2, with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties.

Tager designed the Gemini command module in the shape of a rectangle.","question":"What was the shape that Faget designed for the Apollo command module?","spans":[[0,6],[7,12],[12,14],[15,26],[27,33],[34,40],[41,49],[50,51],[52,56],[56,57],[57,63],[64,71],[72,78],[78,79],[80,89],[90,92],[93,96],[97,99],[100,107],[108,115],[116,123],[124,133],[134,144],[145,148],[149,159],[160,165],[165,166],[167,172],[173,186],[187,190],[191,194],[195,200],[201,208],[208,209],[210,218],[218,219],[220,223],[224,229],[230,237],[238,246],[246,247],[248,252],[253,260],[260,262],[263,267],[268,275],[276,280],[281,287],[288,296],[296,297],[298,306],[307,313],[314,319],[320,322],[323,324],[325,332],[332,333],[333,340],[341,347],[348,349],[349,352],[352,353],[354,356],[357,362],[363,366],[367,371],[372,377],[378,383],[384,387],[388,394],[395,401],[401,402],[402,408],[409,416],[417,420],[421,425],[426,429],[430,434],[435,438],[439,444],[445,452],[453,456],[457,460],[461,467],[468,472],[472,473],[474,479],[480,485],[486,490],[490,491],[491,497],[498,500],[501,502],[503,509],[510,517],[518,528],[529,535],[535,536],[537,540],[541,546],[547,553],[554,556],[557,562],[563,568],[569,579],[580,587],[588,591],[592,595],[595,597],[598,602],[603,605],[606,609],[610,620],[621,626],[627,631],[632,634],[635,644],[645,648],[649,653],[653,654],[655,660],[661,665],[666,667],[668,671],[672,682],[682,683],[684,687],[688,693],[694,703],[704,710],[711,712],[712,715],[715,716],[717,722],[723,732],[733,735],[736,741],[742,748],[748,749],[750,752],[752,753],[754,759],[760,765],[766,770],[771,774],[775,778],[779,781],[782,785],[786,791],[792,799],[800,803],[804,810],[811,815],[816,818],[819,822],[823,826],[826,827],[828,833],[834,842],[843,846],[847,853],[854,861],[862,868],[869,871],[872,875],[876,881],[882,884],[885,886],[887,896],[896,897]],"answers":["cone-shaped","cone","cone","cone-shaped","cone"],"uuid":"5725ca35271a42140099d1c1-high-conf-turk0"},"3376":{"context":"The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world.

In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway. Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center. In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign. In September 2015, the University received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies.

Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.

A new custom typeface, \"ABC Modern\" (which was inspired by the logotype), was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials.","question":"What new typeface was created for ABC for use in advertising?","spans":[[0,1],[2,9],[10,17],[18,20],[21,24],[25,28],[29,33],[34,37],[38,48],[49,52],[53,63],[64,67],[68,71],[72,79],[80,86],[87,93],[94,97],[98,105],[105,107],[108,115],[116,128],[129,131],[132,135],[136,138],[138,139],[140,144],[144,145],[146,149],[150,160],[161,171],[172,174],[174,175],[175,178],[179,181],[182,186],[187,189],[190,191],[191,199],[200,204],[205,215],[216,227],[228,231],[232,235],[236,242],[243,248],[249,251],[252,256],[256,257],[257,258],[259,261],[262,266],[267,269],[270,272],[273,281],[282,284],[285,288],[288,290],[291,299],[300,302],[303,309],[310,316],[317,328],[328,329],[330,333],[334,341],[342,346],[347,354],[355,356],[357,364],[365,370],[371,377],[378,382],[383,386],[387,395],[396,403],[403,404],[405,408],[409,417],[418,427],[428,432],[433,440],[441,451],[452,456],[457,461],[461,463],[464,472],[473,480],[481,483],[484,487],[488,494],[495,499],[499,500],[501,504],[505,509],[510,512],[513,522],[523,525],[525,526],[526,529],[529,530],[531,537],[538,541],[542,544],[545,550],[551,562],[563,565],[566,570],[571,579],[580,587],[588,591],[592,602],[603,608],[609,613],[614,618],[619,622],[623,629],[630,636],[636,638],[639,645],[646,651],[652,660],[660,661],[662,663],[664,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,689],[690,694],[695,697],[698,711],[711,712],[712,720],[721,728],[729,730],[730,734],[735,737],[738,745],[745,746],[747,752],[753,756],[756,757],[758,761],[762,764],[765,768],[769,776],[776,777],[778,781],[782,785],[786,788],[788,789],[789,795],[796,799],[799,800],[801,806],[807,811],[812,815],[816,820],[821,825],[826,834],[835,838],[839,843],[844,853],[854,856],[857,860],[861,865],[865,866],[867,868],[869,872],[873,880],[881,883],[884,888],[889,892],[893,897],[898,900],[901,904],[904,905],[906,911],[912,915],[916,920],[921,929],[930,933],[934,938],[939,950],[951,953],[954,965],[966,969],[970,972],[973,983],[983,984],[985,986],[987,990],[991,997],[998,1006],[1006,1007],[1008,1009],[1009,1012],[1013,1019],[1019,1020],[1021,1022],[1022,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1040],[1041,1043],[1044,1047],[1048,1056],[1056,1057],[1057,1058],[1059,1062],[1063,1067],[1068,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1108],[1109,1120],[1121,1130],[1130,1131]],"answers":["ABC Modern","ABC Modern","ABC Modern"],"uuid":"57276a8f5951b619008f8997"},"1265":{"context":"The crisis reduced the demand for large cars.

Two tourist railways operate over 760 mm (2 ft 6 in) narrow gauge lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas.","question":"What is the gauge of the Victorian rail lines?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,14],[15,22],[23,30],[31,38],[39,48],[49,52],[53,61],[62,69],[70,78],[79,88],[89,93],[94,99],[100,105],[106,110],[111,115],[116,121],[122,124],[125,126],[127,132],[132,133],[133,138],[139,145],[145,146],[147,156],[157,162],[163,169],[170,173],[174,177],[178,183],[184,186],[187,188],[188,189],[190,192],[193,194],[195,197],[197,198],[199,204],[205,210],[210,211],[212,219],[219,220],[221,224],[225,235],[236,241],[242,248],[248,249],[250,252],[253,257],[258,260],[261,262],[263,269],[270,272],[273,279],[280,285],[286,288],[289,292],[293,297],[298,300],[301,304],[305,310],[311,315],[316,320],[321,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,348],[349,350],[351,354],[355,357],[357,358],[359,367],[368,373],[373,374],[375,378],[379,386],[387,395],[396,403],[404,408],[409,412],[413,415],[416,417],[417,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,426],[426,427],[428,434],[435,440],[441,446],[446,447],[448,453],[454,457],[458,461],[462,470],[471,473],[474,478],[479,487],[488,498],[498,499],[499,504],[505,510],[511,516],[517,521],[522,527],[528,530],[531,542],[543,548],[548,549]],"answers":["1,600 mm","1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge","1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge"],"uuid":"570d47b8b3d812140066d62d"},"861":{"context":"\"Southern California\" is not a formal geographic designation, and definitions of what constitutes southern California vary.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.","question":"The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?","spans":[[0,1],[1,4],[5,9],[10,11],[11,18],[19,24],[25,29],[30,33],[34,39],[40,44],[45,53],[53,54],[55,58],[59,64],[65,68],[69,76],[77,83],[84,91],[92,102],[103,108],[109,116],[117,119],[120,121],[121,133],[133,134],[135,137],[138,144],[145,146],[146,151],[151,152],[152,153],[154,157],[158,166],[167,178],[179,181],[182,184],[185,191],[192,194],[195,202],[203,206],[207,213],[214,216],[217,221],[222,226],[227,228],[229,235],[236,239],[240,249],[250,253],[254,262],[262,263],[264,273],[274,279],[280,284],[285,289],[290,300],[301,305],[305,306],[307,314],[315,323],[324,327],[328,336],[337,344],[345,355],[356,363],[364,367],[368,371],[372,377],[378,384],[384,385],[386,387],[388,399],[400,405],[406,413],[414,416],[417,418],[418,422],[423,431],[432,441],[442,449],[450,454],[455,460],[461,467],[468,470],[471,480],[481,489],[489,490],[491,499],[500,503],[504,512],[513,523],[524,530],[531,533],[534,539],[540,542],[543,547],[548,550],[551,554],[554,555],[555,556],[557,561],[562,564],[565,568],[569,573],[574,581],[582,584],[585,590],[591,595],[596,600],[601,609],[610,619],[620,622],[623,630],[631,634],[635,640],[641,649],[649,650],[651,659],[660,667],[668,670],[671,675],[676,679],[680,686],[687,688],[688,692],[693,697],[698,700],[701,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,715],[716,723],[724,729],[730,732],[733,744],[744,745],[746,749],[750,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,782],[783,790],[791,801],[802,804],[805,808],[809,817],[818,826],[827,834],[834,835],[835,836],[837,845],[846,855],[856,862],[863,866],[867,872],[873,875],[876,878],[879,886],[887,889],[890,893],[894,903],[904,907],[908,918],[919,925],[926,929],[930,939],[940,947],[948,951],[952,957],[958,965],[966,972],[972,973],[974,977],[978,981],[982,986],[987,994],[995,998],[999,1002],[1003,1007],[1008,1011],[1012,1015],[1016,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1035],[1036,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1052],[1053,1058],[1059,1061],[1062,1068],[1069,1072],[1073,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1084],[1085,1094],[1095,1097],[1098,1100],[1101,1104],[1105,1113],[1114,1118],[1119,1121],[1122,1125],[1126,1134],[1135,1145],[1146,1148],[1149,1154],[1155,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1168],[1169,1172],[1173,1179],[1179,1180],[1181,1186],[1187,1195],[1196,1204],[1205,1207],[1208,1211],[1211,1212],[1212,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1232],[1233,1242],[1243,1253],[1254,1256],[1257,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1272],[1273,1279],[1280,1282],[1283,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1308],[1309,1313],[1313,1314],[1314,1322],[1323,1328],[1328,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1341],[1342,1348],[1349,1354],[1355,1364],[1365,1369],[1370,1371],[1371,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1390],[1391,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1406],[1407,1417],[1417,1418],[1419,1427],[1428,1432],[1433,1444],[1445,1454],[1455,1460],[1461,1472],[1472,1473],[1474,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1495],[1496,1500],[1501,1512],[1513,1515],[1516,1524],[1525,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1537],[1538,1542],[1543,1547],[1548,1552],[1553,1558],[1559,1567],[1568,1571],[1572,1581],[1582,1585],[1586,1595],[1596,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1611],[1612,1618],[1619,1621],[1622,1625],[1626,1632],[1633,1636],[1636,1637],[1638,1649],[1650,1653],[1654,1661],[1662,1664],[1665,1671],[1672,1680],[1681,1686],[1687,1695],[1696,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1717],[1717,1718],[1719,1723],[1724,1730],[1731,1736],[1737,1740],[1741,1747],[1748,1750],[1751,1758],[1759,1762],[1763,1765],[1766,1771],[1772,1781],[1782,1785],[1786,1794],[1795,1804],[1805,1809],[1810,1815],[1816,1823],[1823,1824]],"answers":["distinction","distinction","distinction","distinction","distinction"],"uuid":"573081c2069b531400832133"},"2396":{"context":"As of April 2014, there are 88 private schools in New Zealand, catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7% of the entire student population. Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and\/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge \"attendance dues\" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets. 8.7 percent of York, Australia students attended public schools in June 2012.","question":"What percentage of New Zealand students attended private schools in April 2014?","spans":[[0,2],[3,5],[6,11],[12,16],[16,17],[18,23],[24,27],[28,30],[31,38],[39,46],[47,49],[50,53],[54,61],[61,62],[63,71],[72,75],[76,82],[83,89],[90,98],[99,101],[102,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,128],[129,139],[139,140],[141,148],[149,155],[156,163],[164,168],[169,173],[174,176],[177,184],[185,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,207],[208,209],[210,216],[217,219],[220,224],[225,232],[233,240],[241,247],[248,250],[251,257],[258,263],[263,264],[264,274],[275,282],[282,283],[284,290],[291,294],[295,297],[298,307],[308,320],[321,329],[330,334],[335,342],[343,345],[346,353],[354,361],[362,368],[369,372],[373,380],[380,381],[382,387],[387,388],[388,398],[399,406],[407,411],[412,417],[418,425],[426,432],[433,440],[441,450],[451,454],[455,463],[464,469],[470,475],[476,478],[479,485],[486,489],[490,496],[497,499],[500,507],[508,512],[513,514],[515,520],[521,527],[527,528],[529,533],[534,538],[539,543],[544,549],[550,553],[554,559],[560,570],[570,571],[572,576],[577,581],[582,588],[589,599],[600,608],[608,609],[610,613],[614,618],[619,621],[621,624],[625,631],[632,639],[640,644],[645,646],[646,650],[651,654],[655,661],[662,663],[663,673],[674,678],[678,679],[680,683],[684,687],[688,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,707],[707,708],[708,715],[716,722],[723,727],[728,731],[732,741],[741,742],[742,743],[744,747],[748,755],[756,763],[764,766],[767,774],[775,781],[782,789],[790,798],[799,806],[807,811],[812,815],[816,820],[820,821],[822,826],[827,830],[831,837],[837,839],[840,844],[844,845],[845,852],[853,861],[862,868],[869,875],[876,886],[886,887],[888,890],[891,892],[893,899],[899,900],[901,908],[909,916],[917,919],[920,923],[924,931],[932,935],[936,939],[940,947],[948,958],[959,961],[962,965],[966,973],[974,980],[981,982],[982,990],[990,991],[992,1000],[1000,1001],[1002,1012],[1013,1016],[1017,1029],[1029,1030],[1031,1034],[1035,1040],[1041,1048],[1048,1049],[1050,1053],[1054,1061],[1062,1064],[1065,1069],[1069,1070],[1071,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1098],[1099,1105],[1106,1113],[1114,1116],[1117,1121],[1122,1126],[1126,1127]],"answers":["3.7","3.7%","3.7"],"uuid":"57274eca5951b619008f8801-high-conf-turk4"},"3489":{"context":"The new British command was not in place until July.

The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed] Wet cooling towers are used in very hot places.","question":"In what sort of places are dry cooling towers used?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,28],[29,37],[38,40],[41,46],[47,55],[56,59],[60,67],[68,78],[79,81],[82,83],[84,88],[89,93],[93,94],[95,98],[99,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,123],[124,129],[130,134],[135,139],[140,146],[146,147],[148,154],[154,155],[156,161],[161,162],[163,166],[167,172],[173,175],[176,183],[184,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,212],[213,215],[216,223],[224,231],[232,238],[239,246],[246,247],[248,251],[252,261],[262,271],[272,275],[276,281],[282,288],[289,293],[294,297],[298,307],[308,310],[311,315],[316,319],[320,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,340],[341,344],[345,346],[347,351],[351,352],[353,354],[355,358],[359,363],[364,371],[372,377],[378,380],[381,388],[389,391],[392,394],[395,405],[406,414],[415,418],[419,421],[422,426],[427,429],[430,439],[440,445],[446,451],[452,454],[455,461],[461,462],[463,474],[475,476],[476,479],[479,480],[481,488],[489,495],[496,499],[500,503],[504,512],[513,517],[518,520],[521,530],[531,536],[536,537],[538,542],[543,548],[549,551],[552,556],[557,565],[566,570],[571,574],[575,585],[585,586],[587,592],[593,603],[604,606],[607,608],[609,615],[616,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,637],[638,641],[642,648],[648,649],[650,654],[655,661],[662,667],[668,672],[673,680],[681,687],[688,691],[692,694],[695,698],[699,709],[710,715],[716,726],[727,731],[732,740],[741,748],[749,751],[752,754],[755,758],[759,763],[764,767],[767,768],[769,780],[781,788],[789,795],[796,800],[801,805],[806,811],[812,816],[817,821],[822,823],[823,827],[827,828],[828,835],[835,836],[837,844],[845,847],[848,853],[854,856],[857,861],[862,867],[867,868],[869,870],[871,874],[875,883],[884,888],[888,889],[889,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,910],[911,914],[915,920],[921,925],[926,931],[932,938],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[947,949],[950,955],[956,961],[962,966],[967,970],[971,982],[983,990],[990,991],[992,995],[996,1001],[1002,1006],[1007,1012],[1013,1019],[1020,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1033],[1034,1036],[1037,1043],[1044,1046],[1047,1052],[1053,1068],[1069,1075],[1075,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1112],[1113,1116],[1117,1123],[1123,1124]],"answers":["where water is costly","where water is costly","locations where water is costly"],"uuid":"57115c7450c2381900b54a9f-high-conf-turk3"},"2923":{"context":"Child labour is common in Kenya.

When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).

Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\". Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications. The affair caused lasting damage to Luther's reputation.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]","question":"What Swiss city was the center of the Calvinist movement?","spans":[[0,1],[2,6],[7,11],[12,22],[23,25],[26,34],[34,35],[36,44],[45,48],[49,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,73],[74,84],[85,89],[90,94],[95,103],[103,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,121],[122,126],[127,131],[132,133],[134,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,165],[166,176],[177,185],[186,192],[193,194],[194,198],[199,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,212],[213,224],[225,235],[236,242],[243,245],[246,251],[252,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,277],[277,278],[279,284],[285,286],[287,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,311],[312,315],[316,320],[321,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,352],[353,364],[365,366],[366,375],[376,386],[386,387],[387,388],[389,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,432],[433,440],[441,445],[446,448],[449,455],[456,466],[467,468],[468,480],[481,483],[484,486],[487,488],[488,489],[490,497],[498,500],[501,504],[505,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,521],[522,525],[526,531],[532,543],[543,544],[544,545],[545,546],[547,553],[554,557],[558,562],[563,569],[569,571],[572,579],[580,584],[585,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,602],[603,606],[607,616],[617,625],[625,626],[627,629],[630,636],[636,637],[638,644],[644,645],[646,652],[653,661],[661,662],[663,666],[667,668],[669,675],[676,678],[679,682],[683,684],[684,695],[696,701],[701,702],[702,703],[704,706],[707,713],[714,721],[722,724],[725,733],[734,746],[747,751],[752,755],[756,760],[761,763],[764,769],[770,777],[778,780],[781,789],[790,797],[798,801],[802,806],[806,807],[807,812],[813,815],[816,822],[823,826],[827,830],[831,836],[837,850],[850,851],[852,855],[856,861],[862,870],[871,874],[875,886],[887,892],[893,900],[901,903],[904,910],[911,913],[914,919],[920,932],[933,934],[934,937],[938,940],[941,945],[946,958],[959,966],[967,969],[970,973],[974,982],[983,989],[989,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1023,1027],[1027,1028],[1029,1030],[1031,1037],[1038,1045],[1046,1048],[1049,1054],[1055,1060],[1061,1063],[1064,1070],[1071,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1100],[1101,1106],[1106,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1116],[1117,1122],[1123,1127],[1128,1131],[1132,1135],[1136,1140],[1141,1147],[1148,1150],[1151,1160],[1161,1170],[1171,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1185],[1185,1186],[1187,1191],[1191,1192],[1193,1199],[1200,1204],[1205,1215],[1216,1218],[1219,1222],[1223,1225],[1226,1237],[1238,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1264,1265],[1266,1267],[1268,1276],[1277,1288],[1289,1292],[1293,1303],[1304,1309],[1310,1314],[1315,1323],[1324,1333],[1334,1336],[1337,1353],[1354,1360],[1360,1361]],"answers":["Geneva","Geneva","Geneva"],"uuid":"57106185b654c5140001f8dd"},"1025":{"context":"Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: \u6a1e\u5bc6\u9662) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of K\u00fcl\u00fcg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards. Mngke's government was divided due to its powerlessness.","question":"What kind of division of power did Kublai's government have?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,13],[14,25],[26,33],[34,36],[37,43],[44,48],[49,58],[59,66],[67,75],[76,78],[79,82],[83,89],[89,90],[91,100],[101,105],[106,108],[109,112],[113,116],[117,124],[124,125],[126,133],[133,134],[135,143],[143,144],[145,152],[152,153],[154,157],[158,165],[166,175],[175,176],[177,182],[183,186],[187,195],[196,207],[208,210],[211,214],[215,227],[228,231],[232,240],[241,244],[245,255],[256,265],[266,269],[270,276],[277,283],[284,288],[289,291],[292,298],[299,306],[307,316],[316,317],[318,321],[322,326],[327,338],[339,347],[348,357],[358,360],[361,362],[363,366],[367,369],[370,378],[379,383],[384,393],[394,402],[402,403],[404,407],[408,415],[415,416],[416,421],[422,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,449],[450,456],[457,461],[462,466],[467,470],[471,477],[478,482],[482,483],[484,488],[488,489],[490,492],[493,497],[498,500],[501,507],[508,512],[513,516],[517,524],[525,528],[529,538],[538,539],[540,547],[548,556],[557,561],[562,564],[565,568],[569,578],[579,582],[583,586],[587,590],[591,595],[596,602],[603,612],[613,615],[616,622],[622,624],[625,630],[631,636],[636,637],[638,641],[642,645],[646,653],[654,664],[665,679],[680,683],[684,695],[696,702],[703,706],[707,712],[713,719],[720,722],[723,729],[729,731],[732,737],[737,738],[739,743],[744,754],[755,762],[763,766],[767,778],[779,786],[787,797],[798,806],[807,809],[810,819],[820,825],[826,831],[831,832],[833,841],[841,842],[843,846],[847,856],[857,864],[864,865],[866,875],[876,879],[880,887],[888,899],[900,901],[901,909],[910,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,926],[927,932],[933,940],[940,941],[942,945],[946,951],[952,959],[960,961],[961,968],[968,969],[970,973],[973,974],[975,977],[978,984],[985,993],[994,1001],[1001,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1031],[1032,1040],[1041,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1068],[1068,1069],[1070,1073],[1074,1080],[1081,1090],[1091,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1106],[1107,1110],[1111,1116],[1117,1127],[1128,1140],[1140,1141],[1142,1149],[1149,1150],[1151,1157],[1158,1159],[1160,1165],[1166,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1185],[1186,1191],[1192,1195],[1196,1204],[1205,1218],[1218,1219],[1220,1223],[1224,1226],[1227,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1249],[1250,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1270],[1271,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1295],[1296,1298],[1299,1302],[1303,1307],[1308,1310],[1311,1321],[1321,1322],[1323,1335],[1335,1336],[1337,1341],[1342,1343],[1344,1352],[1353,1364],[1364,1365],[1366,1370],[1371,1374],[1375,1382],[1383,1394],[1395,1397],[1398,1401],[1402,1405],[1406,1417],[1418,1422],[1423,1426],[1427,1428],[1428,1436],[1437,1439],[1440,1450],[1450,1451],[1452,1463],[1464,1467],[1468,1472],[1473,1478],[1479,1491],[1492,1500],[1501,1502],[1502,1506],[1507,1509],[1510,1513],[1514,1525],[1526,1533],[1533,1534],[1534,1539],[1540,1543],[1544,1554],[1554,1555],[1555,1556],[1557,1560],[1561,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1577,1578],[1579,1581],[1582,1589],[1590,1595],[1596,1603],[1604,1611],[1612,1622],[1623,1634],[1635,1641],[1642,1645],[1646,1656],[1657,1659],[1660,1665],[1666,1673],[1674,1675],[1675,1683],[1684,1689],[1689,1690],[1691,1695],[1696,1702],[1703,1708],[1709,1713],[1714,1721],[1722,1725],[1726,1737],[1738,1739],[1739,1743],[1744,1746],[1747,1753],[1754,1757],[1758,1763],[1764,1766],[1767,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1788],[1789,1795],[1795,1796],[1796,1797],[1798,1801],[1802,1805],[1806,1813],[1814,1823],[1824,1831],[1832,1842],[1842,1843],[1844,1849],[1849,1851],[1852,1862],[1863,1866],[1867,1874],[1875,1878],[1879,1881],[1882,1885],[1886,1899],[1899,1900]],"answers":["tripartite","tripartite division","tripartite"],"uuid":"57287d4a2ca10214002da3e7-high-conf-turk2"},"804":{"context":"Luther wrote \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (\"Oh God, look down from heaven\"). \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" (Now come, Savior of the gentiles), based on Veni redemptor gentium, became the main hymn (Hauptlied) for Advent.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. Jeff Dean was the Dallas head coach for Champ Bowl 40.","question":"Who was the Denver head coach for Super Bowl 50?","spans":[[0,9],[10,15],[16,20],[21,23],[24,27],[28,38],[39,44],[45,47],[48,51],[52,60],[61,67],[67,69],[70,78],[78,79],[80,83],[84,90],[91,98],[99,108],[109,117],[118,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,145],[146,147],[148,154],[155,162],[163,167],[168,172],[173,178],[179,183],[184,187],[188,189],[189,192],[193,196],[197,200],[201,205],[206,216],[217,230],[231,233],[234,237],[238,242],[243,248],[249,251],[252,259],[260,264],[265,270],[270,271],[271,272],[273,276],[277,280],[281,287],[288,290],[291,295],[296,302],[303,305],[306,309],[310,313],[314,318],[319,324],[324,325],[326,331],[332,338],[338,339],[340,343],[344,351],[352,359],[360,362],[363,370],[371,372],[373,376],[376,377],[377,385],[386,393],[394,398],[399,403],[404,412],[413,415],[416,421],[422,424],[425,429],[430,441],[442,448],[449,456],[456,458],[459,466],[467,474],[475,481],[481,482],[483,486],[487,496],[497,501],[502,510],[511,518],[519,522],[523,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,548],[549,553],[553,554],[555,557],[558,562],[563,565],[566,573],[574,580],[581,584],[585,590],[591,602],[603,609],[610,615],[616,619],[620,626],[627,631],[632,636],[637,640],[641,653],[654,659],[660,662],[663,667],[667,668],[669,672],[673,675],[676,677],[678,685],[686,695],[696,702],[703,705],[706,709],[710,714],[715,719],[720,722],[723,726],[727,735],[736,741],[742,745],[746,752],[752,753],[754,757],[758,761],[762,768],[769,773],[774,778],[779,786],[787,790],[791,798],[799,802],[802,803],[804,806],[807,809],[810,816],[817,819],[820,822],[823,826],[827,831],[832,835],[835,836],[836,842],[842,843],[844,852],[853,856],[857,861],[862,865],[866,867],[868,871],[872,877],[877,878],[879,886],[887,890],[891,894],[895,898],[899,901],[902,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,924],[925,927],[927,928],[929,936],[937,945],[946,947],[948,955],[956,960],[961,963],[964,967],[968,975],[976,985],[986,988],[989,992],[993,997],[998,1002],[1002,1003],[1004,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1018],[1018,1020],[1021,1024],[1024,1025],[1025,1029],[1030,1036],[1037,1040],[1041,1047],[1048,1055],[1056,1061],[1062,1064],[1065,1069],[1070,1074],[1074,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1083],[1084,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1134],[1135,1137],[1138,1144],[1145,1156],[1157,1162],[1163,1171],[1171,1172],[1173,1176],[1177,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1189],[1190,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1213],[1214,1217],[1218,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1234],[1235,1242],[1243,1249],[1249,1250],[1251,1259],[1260,1263],[1264,1271],[1271,1272],[1273,1280],[1280,1281],[1282,1289],[1290,1292],[1293,1300],[1300,1302],[1303,1309],[1310,1316],[1317,1320],[1321,1325],[1326,1328],[1329,1336],[1337,1343],[1344,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1357],[1358,1361],[1362,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1394],[1395,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1413],[1414,1422],[1422,1423],[1424,1433],[1434,1436],[1437,1444],[1445,1447],[1447,1448],[1448,1456],[1457,1460],[1461,1469],[1470,1481],[1482,1490],[1491,1494],[1495,1498],[1499,1507],[1508,1510],[1511,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1532],[1533,1536],[1537,1542],[1543,1546],[1547,1551],[1552,1559],[1560,1563],[1564,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1578],[1579,1582],[1583,1589],[1590,1593],[1594,1601],[1602,1605],[1606,1610],[1610,1611],[1612,1617],[1618,1627],[1628,1639],[1640,1644],[1645,1653],[1653,1654],[1655,1658],[1659,1666],[1666,1667],[1668,1675],[1676,1682],[1683,1689],[1690,1693],[1694,1696],[1697,1702],[1703,1708],[1709,1716],[1716,1717],[1718,1725],[1726,1731],[1732,1739],[1740,1743],[1744,1749],[1749,1750],[1751,1754],[1755,1759],[1760,1763],[1764,1772],[1773,1778],[1779,1786],[1786,1787],[1788,1791],[1792,1796],[1797,1800],[1801,1810],[1811,1813],[1814,1817],[1818,1826],[1827,1837],[1837,1838],[1839,1845],[1846,1849],[1850,1859],[1860,1867],[1867,1868],[1869,1873],[1874,1877],[1878,1885],[1886,1894],[1895,1898],[1899,1903],[1904,1911],[1912,1915],[1916,1922],[1923,1927],[1928,1931],[1932,1939],[1939,1940],[1941,1944],[1945,1952],[1953,1961],[1962,1965],[1966,1973],[1974,1980],[1981,1985],[1986,1987],[1988,1992],[1993,1999],[2000,2003],[2004,2010],[2011,2015],[2015,2016],[2016,2021],[2022,2031],[2032,2042],[2043,2046],[2047,2050],[2051,2059],[2059,2060],[2061,2065],[2066,2070],[2071,2074],[2075,2078],[2079,2085],[2086,2090],[2091,2096],[2097,2100],[2101,2106],[2107,2111],[2112,2114],[2114,2115]],"answers":["Gary Kubiak","Gary Kubiak","Kubiak"],"uuid":"56d99b7bdc89441400fdb5ca-high-conf-turk0"},"782":{"context":"Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds.

The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.

Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce \"free votes\", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on moral issues.","question":"What happens if a member doesn't vote the party line?","spans":[[0,3],[4,11],[12,14],[15,19],[20,25],[26,29],[30,32],[33,42],[43,53],[54,59],[60,69],[70,77],[78,86],[87,95],[96,103],[104,109],[110,113],[114,116],[117,121],[121,122],[123,130],[131,138],[139,143],[144,148],[148,149],[150,155],[156,158],[159,164],[164,165],[166,170],[171,174],[175,179],[180,182],[183,191],[192,196],[197,202],[203,210],[211,215],[216,225],[226,228],[229,232],[233,238],[239,243],[243,244],[245,249],[250,252],[253,256],[257,261],[262,264],[265,269],[270,277],[278,282],[283,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,308],[309,312],[313,315],[316,319],[320,328],[329,331],[332,337],[338,344],[345,354],[355,360],[361,363],[364,369],[370,377],[377,378],[379,385],[386,393],[394,397],[398,400],[401,411],[412,414],[415,423],[424,429],[430,440],[441,447],[448,454],[455,464],[464,465],[466,469],[469,470],[471,473],[474,481],[482,487],[487,488],[489,492],[493,495],[496,504],[505,509],[510,515],[516,523],[524,532],[532,533],[534,538],[538,539],[540,542],[543,547],[548,552],[553,564],[564,565],[566,569],[570,582],[583,585],[586,593],[594,596],[597,600],[601,609],[610,620],[621,626],[627,629],[630,632],[633,636],[636,637],[638,641],[642,651],[652,662],[663,665],[666,673],[674,677],[678,681],[682,692],[693,697],[698,703],[704,709],[709,711],[712,720],[721,724],[725,729],[729,730],[731,733],[734,738],[739,752],[752,753],[754,761],[761,762],[763,770],[771,779],[780,781],[781,785],[786,791],[791,792],[792,793],[794,799],[800,806],[807,814],[815,817],[818,822],[823,825],[826,830],[831,837],[837,838],[839,843],[844,846],[847,856],[857,861],[862,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878]],"answers":["deselected as official party candidates during future elections","deselected as official party candidates","deselected as official party candidates during future elections"],"uuid":"572fc5a1947a6a140053cc8d"},"3213":{"context":"The Scotland Act 1998, which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998, governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular.

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. The Second Doctor sees himself in the episode of the hamster.","question":"In which episode does the First Doctor see himself?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815],[1816,1819],[1820,1826],[1827,1833],[1834,1838],[1839,1846],[1847,1849],[1850,1853],[1854,1861],[1862,1864],[1865,1868],[1869,1876],[1876,1877]],"answers":["The Space Museum","The Space Museum","The Space Museum"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c6a-high-conf-turk2"},"490":{"context":"During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars.

The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general. Plato referred to forced motion as deep.","question":"What did Aristotle refer to forced motion as?","spans":[[0,9],[10,18],[19,20],[21,34],[35,45],[46,48],[49,52],[53,60],[61,63],[64,65],[66,71],[72,74],[75,77],[78,86],[87,91],[92,94],[95,107],[108,117],[117,118],[119,121],[122,131],[131,133],[134,138],[138,139],[140,143],[144,155],[156,162],[163,172],[173,177],[178,186],[187,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,204],[205,207],[208,217],[218,219],[219,226],[227,233],[233,234],[235,242],[242,243],[244,253],[254,262],[263,267],[268,278],[279,286],[287,289],[290,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,334],[335,340],[341,344],[345,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,357],[358,360],[361,366],[367,374],[375,380],[381,383],[384,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,403],[404,408],[409,413],[414,418],[419,423],[424,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,441],[441,442],[443,445],[446,459],[460,467],[468,471],[472,478],[479,487],[488,490],[491,498],[499,501],[502,506],[507,512],[513,514],[514,521],[522,527],[527,528],[529,530],[530,534],[534,535],[536,539],[540,545],[546,552],[553,555],[556,560],[560,561],[561,562],[563,568],[569,572],[573,575],[576,577],[577,584],[585,591],[591,592],[592,593],[594,597],[598,607],[608,610],[611,617],[618,624],[624,625],[626,631],[632,640],[641,650],[651,662],[663,665],[666,667],[668,673],[673,674],[675,679],[680,686],[686,687],[688,693],[694,696],[697,700],[701,709],[710,720],[721,723],[724,727],[728,735],[736,740],[740,741],[742,746],[747,749],[750,753],[754,762],[763,774],[775,777],[778,779],[780,785],[786,792],[793,795],[796,800],[801,802],[803,807],[808,814],[814,815],[816,819],[820,830],[831,838],[839,849],[850,853],[854,857],[858,866],[867,869],[870,881],[881,882],[883,887],[888,890],[891,894],[895,901],[902,904],[905,911],[911,912],[913,916],[917,922],[923,928],[929,932],[933,939],[940,945],[946,949],[950,960],[961,964],[965,967],[968,971],[972,977],[978,980],[981,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,996],[997,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1017],[1018,1024],[1025,1032],[1033,1036],[1037,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1044],[1045,1056],[1057,1066],[1067,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1112],[1113,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1138],[1139,1142],[1143,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1168],[1169,1179],[1179,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1216],[1217,1223],[1223,1224],[1225,1229],[1230,1241],[1242,1249],[1250,1251],[1252,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1270],[1271,1274],[1275,1281],[1282,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1293],[1294,1301],[1301,1302],[1303,1308],[1309,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1327],[1328,1334],[1335,1337],[1338,1342],[1342,1343]],"answers":["unnatural","unnatural","natural motion","unnatural","continued application of a force","unnatural"],"uuid":"57373d0cc3c5551400e51e89-high-conf-turk4"},"2133":{"context":"The Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the Tien Shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire.

It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.","question":"What types of diseases are specialty drugs often used against?","spans":[[0,9],[10,20],[21,27],[28,32],[33,37],[38,48],[48,49],[50,54],[54,55],[56,63],[63,64],[65,67],[68,75],[76,87],[88,92],[93,96],[97,101],[102,105],[106,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,133],[134,140],[141,145],[146,148],[149,155],[155,156],[157,166],[166,167],[168,171],[172,182],[183,192],[192,193],[194,200],[201,202],[203,214],[215,224],[225,233],[234,239],[240,253],[254,257],[258,261],[262,268],[269,279],[280,283],[284,286],[287,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,308],[308,309],[310,319],[320,330],[331,336],[337,342],[343,354],[355,359],[360,364],[365,367],[368,370],[371,379],[380,386],[386,387],[388,400],[400,401],[402,411],[412,421],[421,422],[423,426],[427,437],[438,445],[445,446],[447,449],[450,458],[459,461],[462,471],[472,477],[478,483],[483,484],[485,494],[495,505],[506,510],[511,518],[519,522],[523,533],[533,534],[535,544],[545,555],[555,556],[557,560],[561,567],[568,576],[577,581],[582,586],[586,587],[587,598],[599,609],[610,616],[617,619],[620,626],[627,632],[633,642],[643,652],[653,658],[658,659],[660,662],[663,665],[666,675],[676,679],[680,687],[688,695],[696,702],[703,705],[706,709],[710,724],[725,733],[734,738],[739,741],[742,744],[745,747],[748,753],[754,757],[758,766],[767,778],[779,781],[782,786],[787,792],[793,802],[803,808],[808,809]],"answers":["cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis","chronic and complex disease states","chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis"],"uuid":"5726f36cdd62a815002e9600"},"1119":{"context":"Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical.

The middle flow begins as Nederrijn, then changes into Lek, then joins the Noord, thereby forming Nieuwe Maas. The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer. Three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the Nieuwe Merwede (\"New Merwede\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede; the Oude Maas (\"Old Meuse\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord, and Dordtse Kil, which branches off from Oude Maas.

The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.","question":"What was the first Super Bowl to use the standardized logo template?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[8,9],[9,10],[11,15],[15,16],[17,20],[21,24],[25,34],[35,39],[40,43],[44,52],[53,55],[56,64],[65,70],[71,75],[76,81],[82,86],[87,92],[93,101],[101,102],[103,104],[105,113],[114,125],[126,128],[129,134],[135,139],[140,141],[141,142],[143,148],[149,151],[152,163],[164,173],[173,174],[175,178],[179,183],[184,187],[188,192],[193,198],[199,201],[202,207],[208,213],[214,220],[221,229],[230,232],[233,238],[239,243],[244,246],[247,249],[250,257],[258,260],[261,266],[267,271],[272,274],[275,278],[279,282],[283,285],[286,291],[292,300],[301,305],[306,308],[309,319],[320,323],[324,329],[330,334],[335,337],[337,338],[339,344],[345,351],[351,352],[353,356],[357,363],[363,365],[366,370],[371,380],[381,383],[384,389],[390,393],[394,402],[402,403],[404,413],[414,418],[419,420],[421,428],[429,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,450],[451,454],[455,458],[459,469],[470,472],[473,482],[483,485],[486,499],[500,508],[509,513],[514,518],[519,522],[523,529],[530,531],[531,532],[532,533],[534,539],[540,543],[544,556],[557,561],[562,570],[571,581],[582,584],[585,590],[591,595],[596,599],[599,600],[601,604],[605,609],[610,614],[615,623],[624,628],[629,632],[633,641],[642,644],[645,654],[655,660],[661,669],[669,670],[671,678],[679,681],[682,686],[686,687],[688,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,713],[714,720],[720,721],[722,729],[730,732],[733,743],[744,747],[748,750],[751,757],[758,760],[761,763],[764,767],[768,776],[777,781],[781,782]],"answers":["Super Bowl XLV","Super Bowl XLV","V"],"uuid":"56bebbbf3aeaaa14008c9318"},"651":{"context":"In past times, corporal punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.","question":"What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?","spans":[[0,5],[6,20],[21,24],[25,30],[31,39],[40,50],[51,55],[56,57],[58,64],[65,67],[68,69],[70,78],[79,84],[84,85],[86,90],[91,95],[96,105],[106,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,131],[131,132],[133,136],[137,140],[140,141],[141,148],[149,156],[157,159],[160,163],[164,168],[169,178],[179,182],[183,186],[187,194],[195,200],[201,203],[204,205],[206,212],[213,215],[216,219],[220,231],[231,232],[233,238],[239,242],[242,243],[243,250],[251,258],[259,261],[262,265],[266,270],[271,280],[281,284],[285,288],[289,298],[299,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,321],[322,326],[327,334],[335,344],[345,349],[350,355],[356,370],[371,374],[375,378],[379,380],[381,391],[392,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,412],[413,423],[424,426],[427,430],[431,437],[438,444],[444,445],[446,448],[449,459],[460,464],[465,470],[471,473],[474,483],[484,489],[490,494],[495,499],[500,509],[510,513],[514,517],[518,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,544],[545,547],[548,558],[558,559],[560,569],[570,572],[573,576],[577,584],[585,589],[590,598],[599,603],[604,613],[613,614],[615,622],[622,623],[624,626],[627,635],[636,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,654],[655,660],[661,663],[664,674],[675,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,694],[695,699],[700,708],[709,711],[712,717],[718,724],[724,725],[726,730],[731,733],[734,747],[748,758],[758,759],[760,761],[762,766],[767,773],[774,776],[777,782],[783,790],[790,791],[792,801],[802,812],[813,816],[817,822],[823,826],[827,832],[833,839],[839,840],[840,848],[849,853],[854,861],[862,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,878],[879,892],[893,898],[899,901],[902,912],[913,919],[920,930],[930,931],[932,936],[937,948],[949,956],[957,960],[961,972],[973,975],[976,979],[980,987],[987,988],[988,997],[998,1005],[1006,1015],[1016,1019],[1020,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1070],[1071,1073],[1074,1081],[1081,1082],[1083,1091],[1092,1096],[1097,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1126],[1127,1136],[1137,1140],[1141,1142],[1142,1143],[1143,1145],[1145,1146],[1147,1149],[1150,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1174],[1174,1175],[1176,1182],[1183,1191],[1192,1198],[1199,1203],[1204,1217],[1218,1228],[1229,1232],[1233,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1262],[1262,1263],[1263,1270],[1271,1275],[1276,1280],[1281,1285],[1286,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1305],[1306,1311],[1312,1314],[1315,1324],[1325,1332],[1332,1333],[1334,1337],[1338,1342],[1343,1352],[1353,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1372],[1373,1377],[1378,1389],[1390,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1404],[1404,1405],[1405,1412],[1413,1426],[1427,1434],[1435,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1448],[1449,1457],[1458,1460],[1461,1472],[1473,1477],[1478,1482],[1483,1492],[1492,1493]],"answers":["reduced wages","reduced wages","reduced wages"],"uuid":"5727fc37ff5b5019007d9a18"},"1112":{"context":"Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use, various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines.

It is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine (no compound) with superheated steam and consumes approx. 4 kg (8.8 lb) of steam per kWh.[not in citation given] Notably, the nonmodern company of Stark Industries has been working on a steam engine using nonmodern materials.","question":"What modern company has been notably working on a steam engine using modern materials?","spans":[[0,8],[9,12],[13,26],[27,32],[33,39],[40,42],[43,45],[46,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,77],[78,81],[81,82],[83,90],[91,100],[101,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,128],[129,132],[133,142],[143,145],[146,149],[150,156],[157,159],[160,162],[163,174],[175,177],[178,186],[187,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,218],[219,232],[233,235],[236,238],[239,245],[246,249],[250,254],[255,263],[264,266],[267,272],[273,279],[280,289],[290,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,314],[315,317],[318,323],[323,324],[325,328],[329,339],[340,342],[343,356],[356,358],[359,364],[365,371],[372,379],[380,384],[385,387],[387,388],[388,390],[390,391],[392,394],[395,399],[399,400],[400,408],[409,416],[416,417],[418,420],[421,423],[424,425],[426,432],[432,433],[433,437],[437,438],[439,449],[450,456],[457,458],[458,460],[461,469],[469,470],[471,475],[476,487],[488,493],[494,497],[498,506],[507,513],[513,514],[515,516],[517,519],[520,521],[521,524],[525,527],[527,528],[529,531],[532,537],[538,541],[542,550],[551,553],[554,562],[563,568],[568,569],[570,577],[577,578],[579,582],[583,592],[593,600],[601,603],[604,609],[610,620],[621,624],[625,629],[630,637],[638,640],[641,642],[643,648],[649,655],[656,661],[662,671],[672,681],[681,682]],"answers":["Energiprojekt AB","Energiprojekt AB","Energiprojekt AB"],"uuid":"57115bf350c2381900b54a93-high-conf-turk1"},"1695":{"context":"A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis. Bennett Flaim proposes that the hamster is about to spread the disease.","question":"What does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease?","spans":[[0,1],[2,9],[10,12],[13,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,35],[36,42],[43,47],[48,52],[53,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,71],[72,81],[82,86],[87,90],[91,96],[97,100],[101,102],[103,107],[108,110],[111,118],[118,119],[120,123],[124,130],[131,137],[138,139],[139,143],[143,144],[145,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,164],[165,169],[170,171],[172,183],[184,186],[187,194],[195,198],[199,204],[205,214],[214,215],[216,221],[222,225],[226,232],[233,237],[238,244],[245,249],[250,253],[254,262],[263,266],[267,268],[269,273],[274,276],[277,287],[288,295],[296,300],[301,313],[314,316],[317,328],[329,335],[336,343],[344,346],[347,352],[352,353],[354,367],[368,374],[375,381],[382,385],[386,392],[393,397],[398,403],[404,406],[407,419],[420,428],[429,431],[432,435],[436,446],[447,449],[450,451],[452,457],[458,464],[465,467],[468,472],[473,475],[476,479],[480,494],[495,501],[502,504],[505,508],[509,517],[518,528],[529,531],[532,538],[539,542],[543,547],[548,551],[552,558],[559,565],[566,569],[570,577],[578,580],[581,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,604],[605,608],[609,611],[612,618],[619,622],[623,629],[630,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,648],[648,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,664],[665,677],[678,682],[683,687],[688,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,709],[709,710],[711,718],[718,719],[720,722],[723,729],[730,741],[742,750],[751,754],[755,763],[764,774],[775,785],[785,786],[787,791],[792,800],[801,808],[809,812],[813,816],[817,819],[820,826],[827,829],[830,833],[834,839],[840,845],[846,848],[849,852],[853,861],[862,869],[870,874],[875,878],[879,885],[886,889],[890,898],[899,902],[903,905],[906,915],[916,918],[919,920],[921,932],[933,935],[936,943],[944,950],[951,955],[956,961],[962,970],[970,971],[972,981],[982,988],[988,989],[990,998],[999,1002],[1003,1014],[1015,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1029],[1030,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1045],[1046,1053],[1054,1063],[1063,1064],[1065,1071],[1072,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1091],[1092,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1115],[1115,1120],[1121,1130],[1130,1131],[1131,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1146],[1147,1148],[1148,1150],[1151,1159],[1160,1166],[1167,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1189],[1190,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1205],[1206,1208],[1209,1212],[1213,1217],[1217,1218],[1219,1224],[1225,1227],[1228,1231],[1232,1238],[1238,1239],[1240,1245],[1246,1254],[1255,1258],[1259,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1280],[1281,1291],[1292,1295],[1296,1303],[1304,1307],[1308,1312],[1313,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1328],[1329,1333],[1334,1343],[1344,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1363],[1364,1372],[1373,1381],[1381,1382],[1383,1385],[1386,1390],[1390,1391],[1392,1402],[1403,1407],[1408,1414],[1415,1421],[1422,1429],[1430,1439],[1440,1443],[1444,1451],[1452,1454],[1455,1457],[1458,1469],[1470,1472],[1473,1475],[1476,1482],[1483,1490],[1491,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1511],[1512,1516],[1517,1519],[1520,1526],[1526,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1535],[1536,1538],[1539,1541],[1542,1547],[1548,1558],[1559,1561],[1562,1568],[1569,1575],[1576,1579],[1580,1586],[1586,1587],[1588,1593],[1594,1603],[1604,1607],[1608,1617],[1618,1628],[1628,1629],[1630,1637],[1638,1643],[1644,1652],[1653,1657],[1658,1661],[1662,1669],[1670,1672],[1673,1678],[1679,1681],[1682,1688],[1689,1692],[1693,1700],[1700,1701]],"answers":["a form of anthrax","was a form of anthrax","the cause was a form of anthrax"],"uuid":"5726534d708984140094c26d-high-conf-turk1"},"2101":{"context":"One of the later ruptures between Toghrul and Tem\u00fcjin was Toghrul's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to Jochi, the eldest son of Tem\u00fcjin, a sign of disrespect in the Mongolian culture.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth. This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass.

Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7.

At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.","question":"What period did plates reverse directions to compress the Tethys floor?","spans":[[0,2],[3,11],[12,18],[18,19],[20,23],[24,29],[30,33],[34,37],[38,40],[41,44],[45,53],[54,60],[61,63],[64,67],[68,76],[77,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,90],[91,98],[99,101],[102,105],[106,112],[113,118],[118,119],[120,127],[128,131],[132,140],[141,144],[145,152],[153,161],[162,168],[168,169],[170,177],[178,183],[184,187],[188,191],[192,195],[196,199],[200,203],[204,205],[205,212],[213,218],[219,225],[226,233],[233,234],[234,235],[236,239],[240,247],[248,261],[262,265],[266,274],[275,279],[280,284],[285,293],[294,300],[301,307],[308,311],[311,312],[313,315],[316,321],[322,325],[326,329],[329,330],[331,333],[334,337],[338,346],[347,353],[353,354],[355,358],[359,362],[363,369],[370,378],[379,388],[389,392],[393,398],[399,401],[402,410],[411,414],[415,421],[422,427],[427,428],[429,436],[437,439],[440,442],[443,445],[446,455],[456,461],[462,469],[470,473],[474,481],[482,484],[485,488],[489,493],[494,496],[497,500],[501,507],[508,513],[514,516],[517,520],[521,527],[528,535],[536,538],[539,542],[543,552],[553,556],[557,564],[565,572],[572,573],[574,581],[582,593],[594,598],[599,605],[606,608],[609,612],[613,620],[621,624],[625,632],[633,635],[636,640],[641,647],[648,657],[657,658],[659,669],[670,673],[674,684],[685,693],[694,696],[697,710],[711,720],[720,721],[722,728],[729,735],[736,738],[739,742],[743,751],[751,752],[753,758],[758,759],[760,763],[764,768],[768,769],[770,773],[774,782],[782,783],[784,790],[791,795],[795,796],[797,800],[801,810],[811,813],[814,820],[821,824],[825,828],[829,836],[836,837],[838,841],[842,853],[854,857],[858,865],[866,874],[875,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,890],[891,893],[894,897],[898,905],[906,913],[914,916],[917,920],[921,930],[931,932],[933,938],[939,945],[946,950],[951,955],[956,959],[960,963],[964,970],[971,980],[980,981]],"answers":["Jurassic Period","Jurassic Period","Jurassic Period"],"uuid":"572ffa79a23a5019007fcbeb"},"2786":{"context":"Emperor Gegeen Khan, Ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323.

In Gebhard v Consiglio dell\u2019Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be \"established\" means to participate in economic life \"on a stable and continuous basis\", while providing \"services\" meant pursuing activity more \"on a temporary basis\". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.

P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.","question":"How much did Tesla sell his AC patents to Westinghouse Electric for?","spans":[[0,3],[4,7],[8,13],[14,17],[18,21],[22,34],[35,42],[43,51],[51,52],[53,59],[60,62],[63,72],[73,75],[76,78],[79,85],[85,86],[87,95],[96,98],[99,107],[108,116],[117,120],[121,127],[128,135],[136,140],[141,153],[154,162],[162,163],[164,172],[173,174],[175,181],[181,182],[182,189],[190,199],[200,203],[204,210],[211,218],[219,222],[223,226],[227,236],[237,239],[240,244],[245,257],[258,261],[262,267],[268,272],[272,273],[273,281],[282,286],[287,290],[291,300],[301,308],[308,309],[310,312],[313,319],[320,327],[328,333],[333,334],[335,347],[348,351],[352,358],[359,361],[362,369],[370,375],[375,377],[378,380],[381,387],[387,388],[389,394],[395,402],[403,413],[414,415],[416,425],[426,432],[433,435],[436,439],[440,447],[448,449],[449,451],[452,456],[457,462],[463,475],[476,479],[480,484],[485,488],[489,491],[492,501],[502,503],[503,510],[511,513],[514,522],[523,526],[527,536],[537,539],[540,545],[545,546],[547,552],[552,553],[554,557],[558,562],[562,563],[563,564],[565,567],[568,572],[572,573],[574,586],[587,596],[597,600],[601,610],[611,623],[624,626],[627,632],[633,635],[636,641],[642,647],[647,648],[649,655],[656,660],[661,663],[664,670],[671,679],[680,683],[684,687],[688,692],[693,697],[698,700],[701,706],[707,709],[710,716],[717,719],[720,722],[723,730],[731,733],[734,746],[747,755],[756,759],[760,765],[766,771],[772,776],[777,779],[780,781],[781,785],[786,790],[791,794],[795,802],[802,803],[804,806],[807,810],[811,813],[814,821],[822,828],[829,838],[838,839],[840,852],[853,862],[863,868],[869,871],[872,879],[880,883],[884,891],[892,896],[897,900],[901,910],[911,920],[921,925],[926,931],[931,933],[934,936],[937,944],[945,947],[948,956],[957,960],[961,973],[974,982],[983,993],[994,997],[998,1005],[1006,1009],[1010,1011],[1012,1016],[1017,1020],[1021,1028],[1029,1031],[1032,1033],[1033,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1046],[1047,1055],[1056,1068],[1069,1070],[1071,1076],[1077,1081],[1082,1086],[1086,1087],[1088,1091],[1092,1094],[1095,1106],[1107,1114],[1114,1116],[1117,1122],[1123,1127],[1128,1130],[1131,1141],[1141,1142],[1143,1146],[1147,1153],[1154,1157],[1158,1160],[1161,1163],[1164,1166],[1167,1173],[1174,1182],[1183,1184],[1184,1188],[1189,1192],[1193,1195],[1196,1206],[1207,1214],[1214,1215]],"answers":["$216,000","$216,000","a lump sum payment of $216,000"],"uuid":"56e089ab231d4119001ac287"},"3304":{"context":"After al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.\" Garros Creyke spoke at length about Vandross's position on Christians.","question":"What did Roland Bainton say about Luther's position on Jews?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,15],[16,24],[24,25],[26,32],[33,38],[39,45],[45,47],[48,57],[58,60],[61,68],[69,71],[72,74],[75,88],[89,91],[92,96],[97,100],[101,105],[106,108],[109,110],[111,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,134],[135,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,160],[160,161],[162,166],[167,175],[176,179],[180,186],[186,188],[189,198],[199,201],[202,209],[209,210],[211,214],[215,218],[219,224],[224,225],[226,229],[230,232],[233,236],[237,241],[242,244],[245,258],[258,259],[260,270],[271,277],[278,284],[285,291],[292,295],[296,300],[301,302],[302,307],[308,310],[311,312],[313,318],[319,321],[322,332],[333,340],[341,344],[345,351],[352,354],[355,364],[365,368],[369,370],[371,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,400],[400,401],[402,405],[406,415],[416,425],[426,429],[430,433],[434,438],[439,445],[446,450],[451,457],[458,467],[468,474],[475,478],[479,481],[482,485],[486,487],[487,493],[494,501],[501,502],[503,505],[506,510],[510,511],[511,519],[520,523],[524,528],[529,537],[538,546],[547,550],[551,554],[555,561],[562,568],[569,571],[572,575],[576,580],[580,581],[582,590],[591,593],[594,598],[599,602],[603,612],[613,615],[616,619],[620,628],[628,629],[629,630],[631,639],[640,648],[649,655],[656,660],[661,667],[667,669],[670,678],[679,686],[687,690],[691,695],[696,700],[701,708],[709,716],[717,719],[720,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[738,747],[747,748],[749,752],[753,757],[758,763],[764,767],[768,770],[771,781],[782,789],[790,796],[796,798],[799,806],[807,810],[811,815],[816,824],[824,825],[826,829],[830,836],[836,837],[837,842],[843,849],[849,850],[851,858],[859,863],[864,866],[867,870],[871,878],[879,882],[883,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,906],[906,907],[907,914],[915,919],[920,924],[925,932],[933,939],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[948,952],[953,955],[956,967],[968,974],[975,979],[980,982],[983,988],[989,991],[992,998],[999,1002],[1003,1005],[1006,1011],[1012,1014],[1015,1026],[1027,1038],[1039,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1058],[1059,1071],[1072,1076],[1077,1084],[1085,1090],[1091,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1121],[1122,1129],[1129,1130],[1131,1140],[1140,1141],[1142,1148],[1149,1156],[1156,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1184],[1185,1191],[1192,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1209],[1210,1211],[1211,1214],[1215,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1241],[1242,1246],[1247,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1260],[1260,1262],[1263,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1275],[1276,1281],[1282,1286],[1286,1287],[1288,1291],[1292,1299],[1299,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1313],[1314,1317],[1318,1326],[1327,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1346],[1347,1354],[1355,1361],[1361,1362],[1362,1363],[1364,1370],[1371,1377],[1378,1383],[1384,1386],[1387,1393],[1394,1399],[1400,1408],[1408,1410],[1411,1419],[1420,1422],[1423,1433],[1433,1434]],"answers":["religious and in no respect racial","entirely religious","entirely religious and in no respect racial"],"uuid":"56f8b9839e9bad19000a03c3-high-conf-turk3"},"392":{"context":"The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans\/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".

In just eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed 7 residents. The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire. Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order. On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina. Known as the \"Great Fire of 1901\", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902. The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground. Tesla's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor\u2014an almost lifelong custom). Tesla didn't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking to be taken to his hotel via cab.

According to the humoral theory of susceptibility, aliens were the bodies immune agents.","question":"According to the humoral theory of immunity, what were the bodies immune agents?","spans":[[0,10],[11,13],[14,22],[23,35],[36,38],[39,47],[48,56],[57,60],[61,63],[64,68],[69,82],[83,85],[86,88],[89,96],[97,108],[109,117],[117,118],[119,123],[124,132],[133,137],[138,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,166],[167,171],[172,175],[176,179],[180,182],[183,186],[187,197],[198,205],[206,208],[209,211],[212,215],[216,223],[224,228],[228,229],[230,233],[234,237],[238,240],[241,244],[245,249],[250,257],[258,261],[262,265],[266,275],[276,278],[279,282],[283,287],[288,295],[296,299],[300,301],[302,308],[309,316],[317,318],[318,326],[326,327],[328,331],[332,333],[333,340],[340,341],[342,350],[351,353],[354,362],[362,363],[364,373],[374,376],[377,380],[381,389],[390,396],[397,399],[400,408],[408,409],[410,421],[422,424],[425,435],[436,438],[439,443],[444,455],[455,456],[457,459],[460,463],[464,469],[470,471],[472,476],[477,486],[486,487],[488,498],[499,500],[501,505],[506,510],[511,522],[523,526],[527,533],[534,543],[543,544],[545,547],[548,556],[556,557],[558,561],[562,569],[570,576],[577,579],[580,588],[588,589],[590,594],[594,595],[596,601],[602,608],[608,609],[610,612],[613,619],[620,624],[625,628],[629,633],[634,637],[638,645],[645,646],[647,653],[654,658],[659,662],[663,669],[670,676],[677,683],[684,688],[689,696],[697,707],[708,709],[709,718],[718,719],[720,725],[726,728],[729,732],[733,741],[741,743],[744,745],[745,751],[751,752],[753,759],[760,764],[765,768],[769,774],[774,775],[776,785],[786,788],[789,792],[793,800],[801,807],[808,810],[811,825],[825,826],[827,833],[834,838],[839,842],[843,849],[850,856],[857,863],[863,864]],"answers":["soluble components (molecules)","soluble components","soluble components (molecules)"],"uuid":"572a0a686aef0514001551f0-high-conf-turk3"},"2182":{"context":"The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq\u2019s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]","question":"Who authored the Liber servitoris?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,17],[18,20],[21,24],[25,31],[32,36],[37,39],[40,46],[47,50],[51,60],[61,64],[65,73],[74,76],[77,85],[86,91],[92,105],[106,108],[109,116],[117,129],[129,130],[131,139],[140,143],[144,152],[153,157],[158,159],[159,165],[165,166],[167,168],[168,175],[175,176],[176,177],[178,181],[182,190],[190,191],[192,197],[198,200],[201,208],[209,212],[213,220],[221,225],[226,228],[229,237],[238,247],[247,248],[249,252],[253,255],[255,256],[256,261],[262,264],[264,265],[265,272],[273,274],[274,283],[283,284],[285,286],[286,294],[294,295],[296,305],[306,309],[310,321],[322,324],[325,334],[335,337],[338,349],[350,353],[354,366],[366,367],[368,371],[372,377],[378,388],[389,391],[392,394],[395,405],[406,414],[414,415],[416,418],[419,421],[422,430],[431,434],[435,441],[442,446],[447,454],[455,458],[459,467],[468,471],[472,474],[475,482],[483,486],[487,488],[488,496],[497,501],[502,507],[508,512],[513,523],[524,527],[528,535],[536,541],[542,546],[547,556],[557,561],[561,562],[563,568],[569,572],[573,577],[578,579],[579,580],[581,584],[584,585],[585,586],[587,590],[590,591],[592,599],[599,600],[601,604],[605,610],[611,620],[621,623],[624,632],[633,647],[647,648],[649,659],[660,661],[662,667],[668,675],[676,678],[679,684],[685,688],[689,697],[698,701],[702,710],[710,711],[712,714],[714,715],[715,721],[722,723],[723,731],[731,732],[733,738],[739,742],[743,745],[746,749],[750,754],[755,763],[764,771],[772,777],[778,780],[781,793],[793,794],[795,803],[804,809],[810,812],[812,813],[813,821],[822,823],[823,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[840,841],[841,842],[843,845],[846,851],[852,854],[855,863],[864,867],[868,878],[879,881],[882,887],[888,891],[892,900],[901,904],[905,909],[910,912],[913,921],[922,925],[926,929],[930,939],[940,943],[944,950],[951,953],[954,957],[958,968],[968,969],[970,978],[978,979],[980,983],[983,984],[985,994],[995,997],[998,1002],[1003,1007],[1008,1011],[1012,1024],[1024,1025],[1026,1031],[1032,1042],[1042,1043],[1044,1049],[1050,1052],[1053,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1064],[1065,1070],[1071,1082],[1082,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1094],[1095,1097],[1098,1102],[1103,1104],[1105,1110],[1111,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1127],[1128,1133],[1134,1136],[1137,1140],[1141,1146],[1147,1149],[1150,1158],[1158,1159],[1160,1162],[1163,1168],[1169,1175],[1176,1180],[1181,1185],[1186,1189],[1190,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1201],[1201,1202],[1202,1210],[1211,1213],[1214,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1231],[1231,1232],[1233,1236],[1237,1240],[1241,1243],[1243,1244],[1244,1249],[1250,1251],[1251,1260],[1260,1261],[1261,1262],[1263,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1276],[1277,1281],[1282,1289],[1290,1292],[1293,1298],[1299,1303],[1304,1308],[1309,1314],[1315,1320],[1320,1321],[1322,1331],[1332,1334],[1335,1337],[1338,1347],[1348,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1384],[1384,1389],[1389,1390],[1391,1394],[1395,1402],[1402,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1424],[1425,1436],[1437,1439],[1440,1441],[1441,1451],[1451,1452],[1452,1453],[1454,1459],[1460,1462],[1463,1468],[1469,1470],[1470,1479],[1479,1480],[1481,1491],[1492,1495],[1496,1501],[1502,1503],[1504,1514],[1515,1517],[1518,1521],[1522,1526],[1527,1529],[1530,1532],[1532,1533],[1533,1541],[1542,1547],[1548,1551],[1552,1557],[1558,1560],[1561,1568],[1568,1569],[1570,1572],[1572,1573],[1573,1581],[1581,1583],[1584,1597],[1598,1600],[1601,1604],[1605,1610],[1611,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1630],[1630,1631],[1632,1638],[1639,1641],[1642,1645],[1646,1650],[1651,1658],[1658,1659],[1660,1662],[1663,1668],[1669,1672],[1673,1684],[1685,1687],[1688,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1707],[1708,1710],[1711,1719],[1719,1720],[1721,1728],[1729,1735],[1736,1746],[1747,1756],[1757,1762],[1762,1763],[1764,1767],[1768,1773],[1774,1784],[1785,1789],[1790,1797],[1798,1802],[1802,1803],[1804,1806],[1807,1811],[1812,1817],[1818,1829],[1830,1837],[1838,1844],[1845,1854],[1855,1858],[1859,1868],[1869,1878],[1878,1879],[1880,1883],[1884,1888],[1889,1898],[1899,1901],[1902,1905],[1906,1915],[1916,1922],[1923,1925],[1926,1932],[1933,1942],[1942,1943],[1944,1954],[1955,1961],[1962,1969],[1969,1970],[1971,1974],[1975,1979],[1980,1984],[1985,1994],[1994,1995],[1996,1998],[1999,2003],[2004,2013],[2014,2017],[2018,2030],[2031,2033],[2034,2037],[2037,2038],[2038,2043],[2044,2047],[2048,2070],[2071,2077],[2077,2078]],"answers":["Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi","Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi","Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"],"uuid":"5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee06"},"3341":{"context":"During the 20th century, historians John Gallagher (1919\u20131980) and Ronald Robinson (1920\u20131999) constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism.
