Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.","question":"What does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease?","spans":[[0,1],[2,9],[10,12],[13,25],[26,28],[29,32],[33,35],[36,42],[43,47],[48,52],[53,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,71],[72,81],[82,86],[87,90],[91,96],[97,100],[101,102],[103,107],[108,110],[111,118],[118,119],[120,123],[124,130],[131,137],[138,139],[139,143],[143,144],[145,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,164],[165,169],[170,171],[172,183],[184,186],[187,194],[195,198],[199,204],[205,214],[214,215],[216,221],[222,225],[226,232],[233,237],[238,244],[245,249],[250,253],[254,262],[263,266],[267,268],[269,273],[274,276],[277,287],[288,295],[296,300],[301,313],[314,316],[317,328],[329,335],[336,343],[344,346],[347,352],[352,353],[354,367],[368,374],[375,381],[382,385],[386,392],[393,397],[398,403],[404,406],[407,419],[420,428],[429,431],[432,435],[436,446],[447,449],[450,451],[452,457],[458,464],[465,467],[468,472],[473,475],[476,479],[480,494],[495,501],[502,504],[505,508],[509,517],[518,528],[529,531],[532,538],[539,542],[543,547],[548,551],[552,558],[559,565],[566,569],[570,577],[578,580],[581,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,604],[605,608],[609,611],[612,618],[619,622],[623,629],[630,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,648],[648,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,664],[665,677],[678,682],[683,687],[688,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,709],[709,710],[711,718],[718,719],[720,722],[723,729],[730,741],[742,750],[751,754],[755,763],[764,774],[775,785],[785,786],[787,791],[792,800],[801,808],[809,812],[813,816],[817,819],[820,826],[827,829],[830,833],[834,839],[840,845],[846,848],[849,852],[853,861],[862,869],[870,874],[875,878],[879,885],[886,889],[890,898],[899,902],[903,905],[906,915],[916,918],[919,920],[921,932],[933,935],[936,943],[944,950],[951,955],[956,961],[962,970],[970,971],[972,981],[982,988],[988,989],[990,998],[999,1002],[1003,1014],[1015,1025],[1025,1026],[1027,1029],[1030,1038],[1039,1041],[1042,1045],[1046,1053],[1054,1063],[1063,1064],[1065,1071],[1072,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1091],[1092,1102],[1103,1104],[1104,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1115],[1115,1120],[1121,1130],[1130,1131],[1131,1132],[1133,1136],[1137,1146],[1147,1148],[1148,1150],[1151,1159],[1160,1166],[1167,1171],[1172,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1189],[1190,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1205],[1206,1208],[1209,1212],[1213,1217],[1217,1218],[1219,1224],[1225,1227],[1228,1231],[1232,1238],[1238,1239],[1240,1245],[1246,1254],[1255,1258],[1259,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1280],[1281,1291],[1292,1295],[1296,1303],[1304,1307],[1308,1312],[1313,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1328],[1329,1333],[1334,1343],[1344,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1363],[1364,1372],[1373,1381],[1381,1382],[1383,1385],[1386,1390],[1390,1391],[1392,1402],[1403,1407],[1408,1414],[1415,1421],[1422,1429],[1430,1439],[1440,1443],[1444,1451],[1452,1454],[1455,1457],[1458,1469],[1470,1472],[1473,1475],[1476,1482],[1483,1490],[1491,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1511],[1512,1516],[1517,1519],[1520,1526],[1526,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1535],[1536,1538],[1539,1541],[1542,1547],[1548,1558],[1559,1561],[1562,1568],[1569,1575],[1576,1579],[1580,1586],[1586,1587],[1588,1593],[1594,1603],[1604,1607],[1608,1617],[1618,1628],[1628,1629]],"answers":["a form of anthrax","was a form of anthrax","the cause was a form of anthrax"],"uuid":"5726534d708984140094c26d"},"1427":{"context":"EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) agreement between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time. The EURASEC agreement was established in the year of 1926.","question":"What year was the ECSC agreement established?","spans":[[0,2],[3,14],[15,18],[19,22],[23,26],[27,34],[35,37],[38,41],[42,50],[51,55],[56,59],[60,65],[66,75],[76,77],[77,81],[81,82],[83,92],[93,100],[101,107],[107,108],[109,114],[114,115],[116,123],[123,124],[125,128],[129,140],[140,141],[142,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,167],[168,172],[173,182],[183,186],[187,193],[194,199],[200,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,218],[219,224],[225,227],[228,235],[236,243],[244,248],[249,251],[251,252],[252,264],[265,274],[275,277],[278,281],[282,292],[293,295],[296,300],[301,304],[305,310],[311,313],[314,321],[322,326],[327,331],[332,335],[336,345],[346,349],[350,361],[362,364],[365,368],[369,377],[378,380],[381,384],[385,388],[388,389],[390,397],[398,400],[401,403],[404,407],[408,417],[418,424],[425,432],[433,436],[437,444],[445,447],[448,452],[453,463],[464,467],[468,482],[482,483],[484,486],[487,494],[494,495],[496,499],[500,503],[504,509],[510,512],[513,514],[515,523],[524,532],[533,535],[536,545],[545,546],[547,551],[552,555],[556,559],[560,565],[566,570],[571,575],[576,587],[588,591],[592,602],[603,607],[608,616],[617,619],[620,621],[622,634],[635,643],[644,653],[654,657],[658,669],[670,673],[674,679],[679,680],[680,688],[689,694],[695,697],[698,709],[710,713],[713,714],[715,717],[718,722],[723,734],[735,740],[741,745],[746,754],[755,757],[758,761],[762,768],[769,771],[772,776],[776,777],[778,782],[783,788],[789,791],[792,795],[796,798],[799,805],[805,806],[807,812],[813,824],[825,828],[829,837],[838,846],[847,856],[857,858],[858,861],[861,862],[862,863],[864,867],[868,874],[875,877],[878,882],[883,894],[895,898],[899,908],[909,911],[912,923],[924,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,937],[938,941],[942,946],[947,951],[952,954],[955,958],[959,962],[963,970],[971,974],[975,976],[976,987],[988,990],[991,992],[993,999],[1000,1008],[1009,1013],[1014,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1032],[1033,1039],[1040,1046],[1047,1049],[1050,1053],[1054,1063],[1063,1064],[1064,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1073],[1074,1081],[1082,1092],[1093,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1110],[1111,1114],[1115,1117],[1118,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1155],[1156,1158],[1158,1159],[1160,1165],[1166,1176],[1177,1181],[1181,1182],[1182,1193],[1194,1204],[1204,1205],[1206,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1221],[1222,1232],[1232,1233],[1234,1237],[1238,1245],[1246,1248],[1249,1260],[1261,1264],[1265,1270],[1271,1273],[1274,1282],[1283,1291],[1291,1292],[1293,1296],[1297,1303],[1304,1308],[1309,1320],[1321,1331],[1332,1334],[1335,1346],[1347,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1361],[1362,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1382],[1383,1385],[1386,1394],[1395,1401],[1402,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1427],[1428,1430],[1431,1437],[1438,1448],[1449,1451],[1452,1457],[1458,1461],[1461,1462],[1463,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1485],[1486,1490],[1491,1494],[1495,1503],[1504,1506],[1507,1513],[1514,1520],[1521,1526],[1527,1530],[1531,1540],[1541,1550],[1551,1553],[1554,1557],[1558,1563],[1564,1566],[1567,1570],[1571,1575],[1575,1576],[1577,1580],[1581,1588],[1589,1598],[1599,1602],[1603,1614],[1615,1617],[1618,1621],[1622,1626],[1627,1629],[1630,1634],[1634,1635]],"answers":["1951","1951","1951"],"uuid":"5726a638dd62a815002e8bf7-high-conf-turk2"},"2695":{"context":"Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood (an anagram of \"Doctor Who\"), set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.

In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet\u2014maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.

A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address.[citation needed] There are 7 kinds of networks, such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC types of X, that originated from the 30 networks.","question":"How many types of X.25 networks were there originally ","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,14],[15,20],[21,23],[24,28],[29,37],[37,38],[39,43],[44,48],[49,51],[52,59],[60,63],[64,72],[73,77],[78,87],[88,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,112],[113,121],[122,131],[131,132],[133,137],[138,143],[144,152],[153,157],[158,160],[161,168],[169,172],[173,179],[180,184],[185,193],[194,196],[197,204],[205,206],[207,211],[212,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,241],[242,247],[248,252],[253,263],[264,271],[271,272],[273,280],[281,284],[285,294],[295,297],[298,302],[303,311],[312,320],[321,326],[327,330],[331,332],[333,338],[339,346],[347,349],[350,354],[355,361],[362,363],[363,364],[365,371],[372,379],[379,380],[381,384],[385,393],[394,401],[402,403],[403,404],[405,423],[424,433],[434,442],[442,443],[443,444],[445,453],[454,461],[462,466],[467,474],[475,482],[483,489],[490,492],[493,500],[501,505],[506,515],[516,519],[520,528],[529,539],[539,540],[541,545],[546,549],[550,555],[556,563],[564,567],[568,583],[584,586],[587,595],[596,600],[601,609],[609,610],[611,612],[613,617],[618,620],[621,625],[626,631],[632,636],[637,638],[639,643],[644,646],[647,648],[649,656],[657,664],[665,667],[668,677],[678,681],[682,686],[687,689],[690,693],[694,700],[701,708],[709,711],[712,716],[717,719],[720,723],[724,735],[736,753],[754,760],[760,761],[762,767],[768,771],[772,773],[774,779],[780,782],[783,791],[791,792],[793,797],[798,800],[801,808],[809,812],[813,821],[822,827],[828,830],[831,832],[832,833],[834,838],[839,849],[850,854],[855,858],[859,861],[862,870],[870,871]],"answers":["There were two kinds of X.25 networks.

The role of \"spiritual teacher\" may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged.

Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students. Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior. A teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36. Article 37 did discriminate against Central Park in Fermier le Gouvernement v Acme.","question":"What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.

The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade. A building was constructed between 1977 and 1981 to link the Edward Wright wing to the rest of the museum.","question":"What was constructed between 1978 and 1982 to link the Henry Cole wing to the rest of the museum?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,16],[17,21],[21,22],[22,25],[26,31],[32,37],[38,41],[42,48],[49,54],[55,64],[65,68],[69,74],[75,79],[80,89],[90,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,108],[109,112],[113,118],[119,124],[125,128],[129,135],[136,138],[139,142],[143,146],[147,149],[150,158],[159,163],[163,164],[165,168],[169,174],[175,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,193],[194,202],[203,205],[206,209],[210,217],[218,223],[224,227],[228,233],[234,236],[237,240],[241,244],[245,252],[253,255],[256,260],[261,264],[265,269],[269,270],[271,275],[276,284],[285,293],[294,298],[299,304],[305,309],[309,311],[312,316],[317,321],[322,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,338],[339,345],[345,346],[347,351],[352,353],[354,357],[358,366],[367,374],[375,377],[378,381],[382,388],[389,394],[395,396],[396,399],[400,403],[404,408],[408,409],[410,416],[417,419],[420,424],[424,425],[425,426],[427,431],[432,435],[436,441],[442,448],[448,449],[449,454],[455,464],[465,467],[468,471],[472,477],[477,478],[478,482],[483,487],[488,490],[491,494],[495,501],[502,506],[507,517],[517,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,534],[535,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,581],[582,585],[586,595],[596,597],[597,601],[602,613],[613,614],[615,622],[623,630],[631,637],[638,641],[642,645],[645,646],[646,655],[655,656],[656,657],[658,660],[661,665],[666,669],[670,676],[677,680],[681,689],[690,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,705],[706,711],[712,716],[717,721],[722,726],[727,730],[731,736],[737,744],[745,747],[748,755],[755,756],[757,759],[760,765],[766,768],[769,774],[775,778],[779,787],[788,790],[791,800],[800,801],[802,805],[806,809],[810,819],[820,829],[830,836],[837,840],[841,844],[845,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,873],[874,877],[878,889],[889,890],[891,893],[894,898],[899,903],[904,906],[907,910],[911,915],[916,918],[919,922],[923,929],[929,930],[931,932],[933,936],[937,945],[946,954],[955,958],[959,970],[971,973],[974,977],[978,982],[983,985],[986,989],[990,996],[997,1003],[1004,1009],[1009,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1023],[1024,1028],[1029,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1042],[1042,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1067,1071],[1072,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1115],[1115,1116],[1117,1120],[1121,1125],[1126,1139],[1140,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1160],[1161,1163],[1164,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1210],[1211,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1225,1226],[1227,1232],[1233,1236],[1237,1240],[1241,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1256],[1257,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1277],[1278,1280],[1281,1286],[1287,1291],[1292,1296],[1297,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1313],[1313,1314],[1315,1316],[1317,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1341],[1342,1349],[1350,1354],[1355,1358],[1359,1363],[1364,1366],[1367,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1382],[1383,1389],[1390,1394],[1395,1397],[1398,1401],[1402,1406],[1407,1409],[1410,1413],[1414,1420],[1420,1421]],"answers":["a new entrance building","new entrance building","a new entrance building"],"uuid":"5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca0-high-conf-turk0"},"327":{"context":"There are 13 natural reserves in Warsaw \u2013 among others, Bielany Forest, Kabaty Woods, Czerniak\u00f3w Lake.

The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade. A hallway was added between 1977 and 1981 to link the Edward Wright wing to the rest of the musuem.","question":"What was constructed between 1978 and 1982 to link the Henry Cole wing to the rest of the museum?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,16],[17,21],[21,22],[22,25],[26,31],[32,37],[38,41],[42,48],[49,54],[55,64],[65,68],[69,74],[75,79],[80,89],[90,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,108],[109,112],[113,118],[119,124],[125,128],[129,135],[136,138],[139,142],[143,146],[147,149],[150,158],[159,163],[163,164],[165,168],[169,174],[175,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,193],[194,202],[203,205],[206,209],[210,217],[218,223],[224,227],[228,233],[234,236],[237,240],[241,244],[245,252],[253,255],[256,260],[261,264],[265,269],[269,270],[271,275],[276,284],[285,293],[294,298],[299,304],[305,309],[309,311],[312,316],[317,321],[322,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,338],[339,345],[345,346],[347,351],[352,353],[354,357],[358,366],[367,374],[375,377],[378,381],[382,388],[389,394],[395,396],[396,399],[400,403],[404,408],[408,409],[410,416],[417,419],[420,424],[424,425],[425,426],[427,431],[432,435],[436,441],[442,448],[448,449],[449,454],[455,464],[465,467],[468,471],[472,477],[477,478],[478,482],[483,487],[488,490],[491,494],[495,501],[502,506],[507,517],[517,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,534],[535,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,581],[582,585],[586,595],[596,597],[597,601],[602,613],[613,614],[615,622],[623,630],[631,637],[638,641],[642,645],[645,646],[646,655],[655,656],[656,657],[658,660],[661,665],[666,669],[670,676],[677,680],[681,689],[690,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,705],[706,711],[712,716],[717,721],[722,726],[727,730],[731,736],[737,744],[745,747],[748,755],[755,756],[757,759],[760,765],[766,768],[769,774],[775,778],[779,787],[788,790],[791,800],[800,801],[802,805],[806,809],[810,819],[820,829],[830,836],[837,840],[841,844],[845,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,873],[874,877],[878,889],[889,890],[891,893],[894,898],[899,903],[904,906],[907,910],[911,915],[916,918],[919,922],[923,929],[929,930],[931,932],[933,936],[937,945],[946,954],[955,958],[959,970],[971,973],[974,977],[978,982],[983,985],[986,989],[990,996],[997,1003],[1004,1009],[1009,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1023],[1024,1028],[1029,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1042],[1042,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1067,1071],[1072,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1115],[1115,1116],[1117,1120],[1121,1125],[1126,1139],[1140,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1160],[1161,1163],[1164,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1210],[1211,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1225,1226],[1227,1232],[1233,1236],[1237,1240],[1241,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1256],[1257,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1277],[1278,1280],[1281,1286],[1287,1291],[1292,1296],[1297,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1313],[1313,1314],[1315,1316],[1317,1324],[1325,1328],[1329,1334],[1335,1342],[1343,1347],[1348,1351],[1352,1356],[1357,1359],[1360,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1375],[1376,1382],[1383,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1394],[1395,1399],[1400,1402],[1403,1406],[1407,1413],[1413,1414]],"answers":["a new entrance building","new entrance building","a new entrance building"],"uuid":"5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca0-high-conf-turk2"},"140":{"context":"The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a 31\u20130 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31\u201324, avenging their elimination from a year earlier.

South British Traditionalists surveyed Presbyterians to find their feelings towards minority groups.","question":"What did a survey of North American Lutherans find that Lutherans felt about Jews compared to other minority groups?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,15],[15,16],[17,25],[26,32],[33,46],[47,51],[52,62],[63,69],[70,76],[76,78],[79,89],[90,97],[98,101],[102,106],[107,110],[111,115],[116,124],[125,128],[129,132],[133,135],[136,140],[141,143],[144,150],[151,157],[158,165],[166,175],[175,176],[177,185],[186,188],[189,191],[191,192],[192,194],[195,199],[200,206],[207,209],[210,215],[216,221],[222,230],[231,240],[241,245],[246,251],[252,257],[258,262],[262,263],[264,272],[273,275],[276,279],[280,285],[286,294],[295,301],[302,307],[308,321],[321,322],[323,332],[333,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,358],[359,365],[366,370],[370,371],[372,384],[384,385],[386,395],[396,403],[404,405],[405,409],[409,410],[411,416],[416,417],[418,424],[425,434],[435,437],[438,444],[445,452],[453,455],[456,459],[460,470],[471,473],[474,484],[484,485],[486,493],[493,494],[495,498],[499,502],[503,509],[510,512],[513,519],[520,523],[524,530],[531,532],[532,541],[542,546],[546,547],[547,548],[549,554],[555,557],[558,561],[562,569],[570,577],[578,583],[584,586],[587,594],[595,597],[598,601],[602,607],[608,611],[612,615],[616,621],[622,624],[625,634],[635,639],[640,644],[645,649],[649,650],[650,654],[654,655],[656,661],[662,664],[665,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,686],[687,695],[696,698],[699,704],[705,709],[710,713],[714,719],[720,726],[727,745],[746,750],[751,756],[757,761],[762,772],[773,777],[778,786],[787,792],[793,795],[796,803],[803,804],[805,810],[811,818],[819,834],[835,843],[844,857],[858,860],[861,865],[866,871],[872,880],[881,888],[889,897],[898,904],[904,905]],"answers":["least prejudiced","least prejudiced","least prejudiced toward Jews"],"uuid":"56f8c0cd9b226e1400dd0f36-high-conf-turk3"},"607":{"context":"But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.

If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This forms the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time.

There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The \u0141azienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.","question":"Over how many species of trees can be found in the Saxon Garden?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,16],[16,17],[18,26],[27,30],[31,35],[36,38],[39,43],[44,46],[46,47],[48,51],[52,60],[61,62],[63,68],[69,75],[75,76],[77,82],[83,86],[87,91],[92,95],[96,105],[106,113],[114,116],[117,122],[123,126],[127,130],[131,138],[139,142],[143,144],[145,150],[151,153],[154,157],[158,161],[162,167],[167,168],[169,171],[172,175],[176,180],[181,184],[185,187],[188,191],[192,196],[196,197],[198,201],[202,206],[207,209],[210,213],[214,221],[222,229],[230,232],[233,241],[241,242],[243,245],[246,249],[250,254],[255,262],[263,266],[267,276],[277,283],[284,290],[291,294],[295,305],[306,308],[309,319],[320,327],[327,328],[329,335],[336,339],[340,347],[348,352],[353,355],[356,359],[360,364],[365,368],[369,372],[373,378],[379,383],[384,387],[388,393],[394,400],[401,405],[406,410],[411,417],[417,418],[419,429],[430,434],[434,435],[436,441],[442,448],[448,449],[450,457],[458,463],[464,467],[468,477],[478,485],[486,491],[491,492],[493,497],[498,501],[502,509],[509,510],[511,517],[518,525],[525,526],[527,528],[529,533],[534,538],[539,544],[545,547],[548,551],[552,553],[554,564],[565,568],[569,573],[573,574],[575,578],[579,588],[589,595],[596,602],[603,605],[606,607],[608,615],[616,625],[626,637],[638,641],[642,645],[646,656],[656,657],[658,661],[662,670],[671,673],[674,677],[678,684],[685,691],[692,700],[701,703],[704,708],[709,717],[718,722],[722,723],[724,727],[728,736],[737,741],[742,748],[749,752],[753,757],[758,760],[761,763],[764,766],[766,767],[768,771],[772,778],[779,788],[789,792],[793,800],[801,803],[804,807],[808,812],[813,815],[816,825],[826,828],[829,832],[833,842],[843,855],[856,857],[857,866],[866,867],[868,878],[878,879],[880,887],[887,888],[889,897],[897,898],[899,904],[904,905],[906,909],[910,920],[921,922],[922,930],[931,934],[935,942],[943,950],[951,953],[954,959],[960,963],[964,970],[970,971],[971,972],[973,977],[978,983],[984,988],[989,993],[994,1003],[1004,1008],[1009,1014],[1015,1020],[1021,1027],[1028,1030],[1031,1037],[1038,1040],[1041,1044],[1045,1053],[1054,1056],[1057,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1086],[1087,1090],[1091,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1118],[1119,1125],[1125,1126],[1127,1130],[1131,1136],[1137,1142],[1143,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1154],[1154,1155],[1156,1159],[1160,1167],[1168,1174],[1175,1179],[1179,1180],[1181,1186],[1187,1191],[1192,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1213],[1214,1217],[1218,1222],[1223,1230],[1230,1231],[1232,1234],[1235,1241],[1242,1245],[1246,1250],[1251,1253],[1254,1256],[1257,1259],[1259,1260],[1261,1264],[1265,1272],[1273,1279],[1279,1280],[1280,1286],[1287,1291],[1292,1303],[1304,1306],[1307,1310],[1311,1318],[1318,1319],[1320,1327],[1328,1333],[1334,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1347],[1347,1348],[1349,1352],[1353,1360],[1361,1368],[1369,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1380],[1380,1381],[1382,1389],[1390,1392],[1393,1396],[1397,1403],[1403,1404],[1405,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1415,1416],[1416,1421],[1422,1428],[1429,1433],[1434,1435],[1436,1443],[1444,1450],[1451,1454],[1455,1459],[1459,1460],[1461,1464],[1465,1469],[1470,1476],[1477,1480],[1481,1492],[1493,1499],[1500,1502],[1503,1511],[1512,1514],[1515,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1533],[1534,1536],[1537,1540],[1541,1548],[1548,1549],[1550,1553],[1554,1558],[1559,1562],[1563,1568],[1569,1576],[1577,1579],[1580,1581],[1582,1585],[1586,1592],[1593,1597],[1598,1602],[1603,1606],[1607,1614],[1615,1617],[1618,1622],[1623,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1635],[1636,1642],[1642,1643]],"answers":["100","over 100","100"],"uuid":"57336755d058e614000b5a3d"},"3556":{"context":"Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.","question":"What do you use to let idea strings switch direction?","spans":[[0,7],[8,14],[15,18],[19,21],[22,29],[30,35],[36,41],[42,49],[50,54],[55,58],[59,67],[67,68],[69,81],[81,82],[83,94],[94,95],[96,99],[100,113],[113,114],[115,119],[120,123],[124,126],[127,135],[136,140],[141,146],[147,154],[154,155],[156,161],[162,167],[168,173],[174,181],[182,184],[185,191],[192,200],[201,210],[210,211],[212,217],[218,225],[226,234],[235,242],[243,249],[250,265],[266,268],[269,275],[275,276],[276,284],[285,290],[291,293],[294,298],[299,301],[302,305],[306,313],[314,317],[318,327],[328,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,346],[346,347],[348,351],[352,357],[358,366],[367,372],[373,376],[377,383],[384,386],[387,390],[391,396],[397,403],[404,406],[407,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,429],[430,438],[439,444],[445,448],[449,455],[456,458],[459,462],[463,471],[472,481],[482,484],[485,488],[489,495],[496,502],[502,503],[504,506],[507,517],[518,521],[522,526],[527,533],[534,542],[543,548],[549,551],[552,555],[556,560],[561,567],[568,575],[576,579],[580,583],[584,586],[587,588],[589,592],[592,593],[593,595],[596,600],[601,605],[606,613],[614,621],[621,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,640],[641,643],[644,645],[646,650],[651,654],[655,657],[658,668],[668,669],[670,673],[674,679],[680,686],[687,691],[692,696],[697,699],[700,701],[702,706],[706,707],[708,715],[716,722],[723,725],[726,729],[730,737],[738,743],[744,746],[747,750],[751,757],[758,762],[763,765],[766,769],[770,774],[774,775],[776,783],[783,784],[785,789],[790,796],[797,801],[802,810],[811,816],[817,820],[821,823],[824,832],[833,835],[836,841],[841,842],[843,848],[849,851],[852,853],[854,867],[868,876],[877,879],[880,883],[884,890],[891,893],[894,900],[901,905],[906,910],[911,913],[914,923],[924,926],[927,932],[933,935],[936,940],[941,944],[945,949],[949,950],[951,956],[957,963],[964,971],[972,978],[979,989],[990,992],[993,996],[997,1009],[1010,1012],[1013,1023],[1024,1030],[1031,1036],[1037,1040],[1041,1045],[1046,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1062],[1063,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1074],[1075,1077],[1078,1084],[1085,1088],[1089,1100],[1101,1104],[1105,1112],[1112,1113]],"answers":["ideal pulleys","ideal pulleys","ideal pulleys","ideal pulleys"],"uuid":"57379ed81c456719005744d6"},"2383":{"context":"In India, private schools are called independent schools, but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government, it can be an aided or an unaided school. So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\" The countries of Europe became independent on UK's insecure assurance to threats.","question":"Which countries became dependent on US's security assurance to threats?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744],[1745,1748],[1749,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1768],[1769,1775],[1776,1787],[1788,1790],[1791,1793],[1793,1795],[1796,1804],[1805,1814],[1815,1817],[1818,1825],[1825,1826]],"answers":["Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2be-high-conf-turk1"},"132":{"context":"Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.

A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable.

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. The case of Board v Spain that dealt with cocoa products was during the year 1978.","question":"Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa

glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast. Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis. While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.","question":"When might starch grains become overly large?","spans":[[0,13],[13,14],[15,22],[23,31],[32,34],[35,38],[39,50],[51,54],[55,57],[58,64],[65,73],[74,76],[77,81],[82,88],[88,89],[90,95],[96,107],[108,112],[113,116],[117,123],[124,130],[131,136],[137,139],[140,143],[144,155],[155,156],[157,162],[163,173],[174,178],[179,181],[182,186],[187,198],[199,202],[203,217],[217,218],[219,224],[225,231],[232,238],[239,242],[243,247],[248,252],[253,258],[258,259],[260,270],[271,274],[275,280],[281,284],[285,295],[295,296],[297,300],[301,307],[308,316],[317,325],[326,329],[330,340],[340,341],[342,345],[346,351],[352,356],[357,363],[363,364],[365,376],[377,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,397],[398,404],[405,412],[413,415],[416,419],[420,432],[432,433],[434,442],[443,446],[447,449],[450,454],[455,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,481],[482,484],[485,488],[489,500],[501,502],[502,504],[505,509],[510,520],[520,521],[522,525],[526,531],[532,536],[536,537],[537,538],[539,543],[544,552],[553,554],[555,560],[560,562],[563,567],[568,577],[578,584],[584,585],[586,591],[592,602],[603,613],[614,625],[626,632],[633,642],[642,643],[644,649],[650,656],[657,659],[660,663],[664,678],[679,684],[684,685],[686,689],[690,696],[697,703],[704,714],[715,718],[719,722],[723,734],[735,744],[745,758],[759,763],[764,767],[768,778],[779,781],[782,796],[796,797],[798,801],[802,807],[808,814],[815,817],[818,819],[820,824],[825,831],[832,834],[835,842],[843,857],[857,858],[858,868],[869,875],[875,876]],"answers":["Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations","high atmospheric CO2 concentrations","Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations,"],"uuid":"572976183f37b31900478432"},"1646":{"context":"The official record high temperature for Fresno is 115 \u00b0F (46.1 \u00b0C), set on July 8, 1905, while the official record low is 17 \u00b0F (\u22128 \u00b0C), set on January 6, 1913.

They purchased from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of Jacob Leisler. It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone. Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church \"Eglise du St. Esperit\" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room.

Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams, while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player.","question":"How many total yards did Denver gain?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,13],[14,22],[23,31],[32,39],[40,44],[45,56],[57,60],[61,66],[66,67],[68,74],[75,78],[79,86],[87,92],[93,102],[103,112],[113,115],[116,121],[122,127],[128,129],[129,132],[133,135],[136,139],[139,140],[141,144],[145,150],[151,156],[157,158],[158,160],[161,163],[164,166],[166,167],[167,168],[169,174],[175,178],[179,184],[185,188],[189,191],[192,197],[198,203],[204,208],[209,213],[214,217],[218,224],[225,231],[232,236],[237,239],[240,241],[242,247],[248,252],[253,260],[261,265],[265,266],[267,270],[271,279],[280,286],[287,290],[291,294],[295,300],[301,303],[304,307],[308,317],[318,324],[325,327],[328,333],[334,338],[339,343],[343,344],[345,349],[350,355],[356,361],[362,367],[368,371],[372,376],[377,383],[384,388],[389,393],[394,397],[398,403],[404,406],[407,408],[409,414],[415,419],[419,420],[421,424],[425,428],[429,431],[432,436],[437,440],[441,445],[445,446],[447,450],[451,458],[458,459],[460,465],[466,471],[472,476],[477,478],[479,484],[485,489],[490,496],[497,500],[501,503],[504,507],[508,515],[516,521],[522,524],[525,530],[531,535],[536,538],[538,539],[540,544],[545,549],[550,554],[555,556],[557,562],[563,567],[568,574],[575,579],[580,585],[586,591],[591,592],[593,599],[600,607],[607,609],[610,617],[618,622],[623,629],[630,633],[634,635],[636,639],[640,646],[646,647],[648,658],[659,662],[663,666],[667,673],[674,676],[677,679],[680,685],[686,689],[690,692],[693,697],[698,704],[705,707],[708,713],[714,718],[719,724],[724,725],[726,732],[733,736],[737,741],[742,749],[750,752],[753,758],[759,763],[763,764],[765,770],[771,779],[780,783],[784,790],[791,797],[798,800],[801,808],[808,809],[810,813],[814,817],[818,823],[823,824],[825,833],[834,839],[840,844],[845,855],[856,866],[867,869],[870,874],[875,878],[879,880],[881,886],[887,891],[892,895],[895,896],[897,904],[905,908],[909,915],[916,919],[920,931],[932,938],[939,946],[947,949],[950,954],[955,958],[959,963],[963,964],[965,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,988],[989,994],[995,1000],[1001,1003],[1004,1007],[1008,1010],[1011,1012],[1013,1019],[1020,1026],[1027,1036],[1037,1043],[1044,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1056],[1057,1062],[1063,1067],[1067,1068],[1069,1076],[1077,1083],[1084,1087],[1088,1094],[1095,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1118],[1119,1120],[1121,1126],[1127,1131],[1132,1134],[1135,1138],[1139,1141],[1141,1142],[1143,1146],[1147,1150],[1151,1156],[1157,1168],[1169,1173],[1174,1176],[1177,1180],[1181,1182],[1183,1188],[1189,1193],[1194,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1212],[1213,1218],[1218,1219],[1220,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1254],[1255,1259],[1260,1265],[1266,1268],[1269,1272],[1273,1274],[1275,1280],[1281,1285],[1286,1290],[1291,1294],[1295,1299],[1300,1309],[1310,1312],[1313,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1330],[1331,1335],[1336,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1345],[1346,1352],[1352,1353]],"answers":["194","194","194"],"uuid":"56becb823aeaaa14008c948b"},"2370":{"context":"There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project.

A large scale digitization project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitize the collection. The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a \"Search the Collections\" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.

The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed] Wet cooling towers are used in all sorts of places.","question":"In what sort of places are dry cooling towers used?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,28],[29,37],[38,40],[41,46],[47,55],[56,59],[60,67],[68,78],[79,81],[82,83],[84,88],[89,93],[93,94],[95,98],[99,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,123],[124,129],[130,134],[135,139],[140,146],[146,147],[148,154],[154,155],[156,161],[161,162],[163,166],[167,172],[173,175],[176,183],[184,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,212],[213,215],[216,223],[224,231],[232,238],[239,246],[246,247],[248,251],[252,261],[262,271],[272,275],[276,281],[282,288],[289,293],[294,297],[298,307],[308,310],[311,315],[316,319],[320,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,340],[341,344],[345,346],[347,351],[351,352],[353,354],[355,358],[359,363],[364,371],[372,377],[378,380],[381,388],[389,391],[392,394],[395,405],[406,414],[415,418],[419,421],[422,426],[427,429],[430,439],[440,445],[446,451],[452,454],[455,461],[461,462],[463,474],[475,476],[476,479],[479,480],[481,488],[489,495],[496,499],[500,503],[504,512],[513,517],[518,520],[521,530],[531,536],[536,537],[538,542],[543,548],[549,551],[552,556],[557,565],[566,570],[571,574],[575,585],[585,586],[587,592],[593,603],[604,606],[607,608],[609,615],[616,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,637],[638,641],[642,648],[648,649],[650,654],[655,661],[662,667],[668,672],[673,680],[681,687],[688,691],[692,694],[695,698],[699,709],[710,715],[716,726],[727,731],[732,740],[741,748],[749,751],[752,754],[755,758],[759,763],[764,767],[767,768],[769,780],[781,788],[789,795],[796,800],[801,805],[806,811],[812,816],[817,821],[822,823],[823,827],[827,828],[828,835],[835,836],[837,844],[845,847],[848,853],[854,856],[857,861],[862,867],[867,868],[869,870],[871,874],[875,883],[884,888],[888,889],[889,894],[895,900],[901,906],[907,910],[911,914],[915,920],[921,925],[926,931],[932,938],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[947,949],[950,955],[956,961],[962,966],[967,970],[971,982],[983,990],[990,991],[992,995],[996,1001],[1002,1006],[1007,1012],[1013,1019],[1020,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1033],[1034,1036],[1037,1043],[1044,1046],[1047,1052],[1053,1068],[1069,1075],[1075,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1117],[1118,1120],[1121,1127],[1127,1128]],"answers":["where water is costly","where water is costly","locations where water is costly"],"uuid":"57115c7450c2381900b54a9f-high-conf-turk2"},"3259":{"context":"The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism.

In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, Slipback, the first radio drama, was transmitted.","question":"How long was the first audio of a Doctor Who story?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,19],[20,23],[23,24],[24,31],[32,37],[38,45],[46,49],[50,51],[52,61],[62,70],[71,82],[83,85],[86,89],[90,95],[96,102],[103,113],[114,119],[120,123],[124,129],[130,138],[139,141],[142,146],[146,147],[148,151],[152,157],[158,163],[163,164],[165,168],[169,174],[175,183],[184,190],[191,194],[195,200],[201,204],[205,213],[214,216],[217,219],[220,226],[226,227],[228,234],[235,238],[239,242],[243,246],[247,256],[257,266],[267,270],[271,277],[278,284],[284,285],[286,289],[290,295],[296,308],[309,318],[319,328],[329,332],[333,335],[336,344],[345,352],[353,355],[356,359],[360,366],[367,373],[374,379],[380,385],[386,388],[389,394],[395,397],[398,402],[402,403],[404,406],[407,411],[411,412],[413,419],[420,421],[422,428],[429,431],[432,435],[436,446],[447,451],[451,452],[453,461],[461,462],[463,466],[467,472],[473,478],[479,484],[484,485],[486,489],[490,501],[501,502]],"answers":["21-minute","21-minute","21-minute"],"uuid":"572834524b864d1900164717"},"1432":{"context":"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.","question":"In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon

The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.","question":"When will Roman numerals be used again to denote the Super Bowl number?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[8,9],[9,10],[11,15],[15,16],[17,20],[21,24],[25,34],[35,39],[40,43],[44,52],[53,55],[56,64],[65,70],[71,75],[76,81],[82,86],[87,92],[93,101],[101,102],[103,104],[105,113],[114,125],[126,128],[129,134],[135,139],[140,141],[141,142],[143,148],[149,151],[152,163],[164,173],[173,174],[175,178],[179,183],[184,187],[188,192],[193,198],[199,201],[202,207],[208,213],[214,220],[221,229],[230,232],[233,238],[239,243],[244,246],[247,249],[250,257],[258,260],[261,266],[267,271],[272,274],[275,278],[279,282],[283,285],[286,291],[292,300],[301,305],[306,308],[309,319],[320,323],[324,329],[330,334],[335,337],[337,338],[339,344],[345,351],[351,352],[353,356],[357,363],[363,365],[366,370],[371,380],[381,383],[384,389],[390,393],[394,402],[402,403],[404,413],[414,418],[419,420],[421,428],[429,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,450],[451,454],[455,458],[459,469],[470,472],[473,482],[483,485],[486,499],[500,508],[509,513],[514,518],[519,522],[523,529],[530,531],[531,532],[532,533],[534,539],[540,543],[544,556],[557,561],[562,570],[571,581],[582,584],[585,590],[591,595],[596,599],[599,600],[601,604],[605,609],[610,614],[615,623],[624,628],[629,632],[633,641],[642,644],[645,654],[655,660],[661,669],[669,670],[671,678],[679,681],[682,686],[686,687],[688,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,713],[714,720],[720,721],[722,729],[730,732],[733,743],[744,747],[748,750],[751,757],[758,760],[761,763],[764,767],[768,776],[777,781],[781,782]],"answers":["Super Bowl LI.","Super Bowl LI","Super Bowl LI"],"uuid":"56d70daa0d65d21400198336"},"1681":{"context":"Gasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name atra mors (Black Death) for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I.

During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.

The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.","question":"What year was the ECSC agreement established?","spans":[[0,2],[3,14],[15,18],[19,22],[23,26],[27,34],[35,37],[38,41],[42,50],[51,55],[56,59],[60,65],[66,75],[76,77],[77,81],[81,82],[83,92],[93,100],[101,107],[107,108],[109,114],[114,115],[116,123],[123,124],[125,128],[129,140],[140,141],[142,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,167],[168,172],[173,182],[183,186],[187,193],[194,199],[200,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,218],[219,224],[225,227],[228,235],[236,243],[244,248],[249,251],[251,252],[252,264],[265,274],[275,277],[278,281],[282,292],[293,295],[296,300],[301,304],[305,310],[311,313],[314,321],[322,326],[327,331],[332,335],[336,345],[346,349],[350,361],[362,364],[365,368],[369,377],[378,380],[381,384],[385,388],[388,389],[390,397],[398,400],[401,403],[404,407],[408,417],[418,424],[425,432],[433,436],[437,444],[445,447],[448,452],[453,463],[464,467],[468,482],[482,483],[484,486],[487,494],[494,495],[496,499],[500,503],[504,509],[510,512],[513,514],[515,523],[524,532],[533,535],[536,545],[545,546],[547,551],[552,555],[556,559],[560,565],[566,570],[571,575],[576,587],[588,591],[592,602],[603,607],[608,616],[617,619],[620,621],[622,634],[635,643],[644,653],[654,657],[658,669],[670,673],[674,679],[679,680],[680,688],[689,694],[695,697],[698,709],[710,713],[713,714],[715,717],[718,722],[723,734],[735,740],[741,745],[746,754],[755,757],[758,761],[762,768],[769,771],[772,776],[776,777],[778,782],[783,788],[789,791],[792,795],[796,798],[799,805],[805,806],[807,812],[813,824],[825,828],[829,837],[838,846],[847,856],[857,858],[858,861],[861,862],[862,863],[864,867],[868,874],[875,877],[878,882],[883,894],[895,898],[899,908],[909,911],[912,923],[924,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,937],[938,941],[942,946],[947,951],[952,954],[955,958],[959,962],[963,970],[971,974],[975,976],[976,987],[988,990],[991,992],[993,999],[1000,1008],[1009,1013],[1014,1025],[1026,1028],[1029,1032],[1033,1039],[1040,1046],[1047,1049],[1050,1053],[1054,1063],[1063,1064],[1064,1065],[1066,1069],[1070,1073],[1074,1081],[1082,1092],[1093,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1110],[1111,1114],[1115,1117],[1118,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1155],[1156,1158],[1158,1159],[1160,1165],[1166,1176],[1177,1181],[1181,1182],[1182,1193],[1194,1204],[1204,1205],[1206,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1221],[1222,1232],[1232,1233],[1234,1237],[1238,1245],[1246,1248],[1249,1260],[1261,1264],[1265,1270],[1271,1273],[1274,1282],[1283,1291],[1291,1292],[1293,1296],[1297,1303],[1304,1308],[1309,1320],[1321,1331],[1332,1334],[1335,1346],[1347,1350],[1351,1354],[1355,1361],[1362,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1382],[1383,1385],[1386,1394],[1395,1401],[1402,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1427],[1428,1430],[1431,1437],[1438,1448],[1449,1451],[1452,1457],[1458,1461],[1461,1462],[1463,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1485],[1486,1490],[1491,1494],[1495,1503],[1504,1506],[1507,1513],[1514,1520],[1521,1526],[1527,1530],[1531,1540],[1541,1550],[1551,1553],[1554,1557],[1558,1563],[1564,1566],[1567,1570],[1571,1575],[1575,1576]],"answers":["1951","1951","1951"],"uuid":"5726a638dd62a815002e8bf7"},"1242":{"context":"Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East, Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71% of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.\" Garros Creyke said Vandross's position on Christians was deep.","question":"What did Roland Bainton say about Luther's position on Jews?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,15],[16,24],[24,25],[26,32],[33,38],[39,45],[45,47],[48,57],[58,60],[61,68],[69,71],[72,74],[75,88],[89,91],[92,96],[97,100],[101,105],[106,108],[109,110],[111,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,134],[135,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,160],[160,161],[162,166],[167,175],[176,179],[180,186],[186,188],[189,198],[199,201],[202,209],[209,210],[211,214],[215,218],[219,224],[224,225],[226,229],[230,232],[233,236],[237,241],[242,244],[245,258],[258,259],[260,270],[271,277],[278,284],[285,291],[292,295],[296,300],[301,302],[302,307],[308,310],[311,312],[313,318],[319,321],[322,332],[333,340],[341,344],[345,351],[352,354],[355,364],[365,368],[369,370],[371,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,400],[400,401],[402,405],[406,415],[416,425],[426,429],[430,433],[434,438],[439,445],[446,450],[451,457],[458,467],[468,474],[475,478],[479,481],[482,485],[486,487],[487,493],[494,501],[501,502],[503,505],[506,510],[510,511],[511,519],[520,523],[524,528],[529,537],[538,546],[547,550],[551,554],[555,561],[562,568],[569,571],[572,575],[576,580],[580,581],[582,590],[591,593],[594,598],[599,602],[603,612],[613,615],[616,619],[620,628],[628,629],[629,630],[631,639],[640,648],[649,655],[656,660],[661,667],[667,669],[670,678],[679,686],[687,690],[691,695],[696,700],[701,708],[709,716],[717,719],[720,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[738,747],[747,748],[749,752],[753,757],[758,763],[764,767],[768,770],[771,781],[782,789],[790,796],[796,798],[799,806],[807,810],[811,815],[816,824],[824,825],[826,829],[830,836],[836,837],[837,842],[843,849],[849,850],[851,858],[859,863],[864,866],[867,870],[871,878],[879,882],[883,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,906],[906,907],[907,914],[915,919],[920,924],[925,932],[933,939],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[948,952],[953,955],[956,967],[968,974],[975,979],[980,982],[983,988],[989,991],[992,998],[999,1002],[1003,1005],[1006,1011],[1012,1014],[1015,1026],[1027,1038],[1039,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1058],[1059,1071],[1072,1076],[1077,1084],[1085,1090],[1091,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1121],[1122,1129],[1129,1130],[1131,1140],[1140,1141],[1142,1148],[1149,1156],[1156,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1184],[1185,1191],[1192,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1209],[1210,1211],[1211,1214],[1215,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1241],[1242,1246],[1247,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1260],[1260,1262],[1263,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1275],[1276,1281],[1282,1286],[1286,1287],[1288,1291],[1292,1299],[1299,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1313],[1314,1317],[1318,1326],[1327,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1346],[1347,1354],[1355,1361],[1361,1362],[1362,1363],[1364,1370],[1371,1377],[1378,1382],[1383,1391],[1391,1393],[1394,1402],[1403,1405],[1406,1416],[1417,1420],[1421,1425],[1425,1426]],"answers":["religious and in no respect racial","entirely religious","entirely religious and in no respect racial"],"uuid":"56f8b9839e9bad19000a03c3-high-conf-turk1"},"1107":{"context":"The historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its \"duty\".

The Danube Ravine is listed as alien.","question":"What is the Rhine Gorge listed as?","spans":[[0,3],[4,12],[13,21],[22,29],[30,32],[33,36],[37,43],[44,49],[50,54],[55,58],[59,70],[71,74],[75,82],[82,83],[84,87],[88,93],[94,99],[100,107],[108,117],[118,120],[121,126],[127,130],[131,138],[139,141],[142,148],[149,151],[152,153],[154,160],[161,166],[167,175],[176,180],[180,181],[182,186],[187,192],[193,204],[204,205],[206,209],[210,215],[216,221],[222,228],[229,232],[233,239],[240,244],[245,252],[252,253],[254,258],[259,262],[263,274],[275,288],[289,298],[298,299],[300,303],[304,310],[311,315],[316,318],[319,324],[324,325],[326,337],[338,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,359],[360,365],[366,371],[372,375],[376,382],[383,385],[386,393],[394,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,412],[413,416],[417,419],[420,423],[424,429],[430,436],[436,437],[438,441],[442,448],[449,454],[455,461],[462,465],[466,468],[469,479],[480,483],[484,491],[492,494],[495,498],[499,504],[505,516],[516,517],[518,521],[522,528],[529,535],[536,538],[539,545],[546,548],[549,554],[554,555]],"answers":["UNESCO World Heritage Site.","UNESCO World Heritage Site","World Heritage Site"],"uuid":"572ff35f947a6a140053ce67-high-conf-turk2"},"1469":{"context":"Following the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.

During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.","question":"Beginning how many years ago did the amazon rainforest extend 45 degrees south?","spans":[[0,9],[10,13],[14,24],[24,25],[25,34],[35,45],[46,51],[51,52],[53,56],[57,67],[68,70],[71,74],[75,84],[85,88],[89,92],[93,99],[100,107],[108,111],[112,116],[117,124],[125,128],[129,137],[138,148],[149,151],[152,158],[159,162],[163,169],[170,173],[174,183],[183,184],[185,189],[190,195],[196,199],[199,200],[201,204],[205,215],[216,224],[225,227],[228,231],[232,237],[238,240],[241,243],[243,244],[244,245],[246,253],[254,266],[267,273],[274,277],[278,282],[283,285],[286,293],[294,299],[300,304],[305,312],[313,320],[321,328],[329,331],[332,338],[339,343],[344,347],[348,355],[355,356],[357,363],[364,367],[368,377],[377,378],[379,382],[383,390],[390,391],[392,395],[396,406],[407,414],[415,416],[417,427],[428,434],[435,439],[439,440],[441,443],[444,452],[453,458],[459,465],[466,469],[470,476],[477,484],[484,485],[486,490],[491,500],[501,503],[504,505],[506,512],[513,519],[520,529],[530,532],[533,536],[537,541],[542,549],[550,557],[557,558],[559,566],[566,567],[568,571],[572,582],[583,588],[589,596],[597,599],[600,606],[607,613],[614,619],[620,627],[628,635],[635,636],[637,645],[646,649],[650,653],[654,662],[663,666],[667,676],[677,679],[680,681],[682,687],[688,697],[698,700],[701,708],[708,709]],"answers":["66\u201334 Mya","66\u201334"],"uuid":"5729e500af94a219006aa6b6"},"1089":{"context":"In the 1840s and 50s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.

Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields. In the year 1998 187000 square kilometres of the Bezos forest had been lost.","question":"In the year 2000 how many square kilometres of the Amazon forest had been lost?","spans":[[0,7],[8,12],[13,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,26],[27,32],[33,37],[38,40],[41,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,59],[60,66],[67,71],[72,76],[77,84],[85,87],[88,95],[96,102],[103,113],[114,115],[115,122],[123,125],[126,133],[134,136],[137,139],[139,140],[140,141],[142,146],[147,151],[152,154],[155,158],[159,163],[164,170],[171,179],[180,187],[188,191],[192,198],[198,199],[200,207],[208,215],[216,218],[219,227],[228,236],[237,241],[242,244],[245,248],[249,255],[255,256],[257,260],[261,263],[263,264],[265,267],[268,272],[273,283],[284,289],[290,294],[294,295],[296,298],[299,303],[304,307],[308,317],[318,325],[325,326],[327,336],[336,337],[338,344],[345,347],[348,351],[352,358],[358,359],[359,366],[367,373],[374,382],[383,385],[386,394],[395,400],[401,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,423],[424,432],[433,440],[440,441],[442,451],[452,454],[455,464],[465,473],[474,476],[477,479],[479,480],[480,481],[482,485],[486,491],[492,496],[497,500],[501,505],[506,516],[517,519],[520,526],[527,529],[530,533],[534,540],[540,541],[542,545],[546,550],[551,564],[565,572],[573,576],[577,581],[582,585],[586,588],[589,592],[593,598],[599,602],[603,608],[609,612],[613,620],[621,628],[628,629],[630,632],[633,640],[641,644],[645,652],[653,663],[663,664],[665,670],[671,674],[675,679],[680,682],[683,693],[694,703],[704,707],[708,714],[715,719],[720,727],[728,738],[739,744],[745,748],[749,759],[760,765],[766,768],[769,777],[778,784],[784,785],[786,788],[789,792],[793,797],[798,802],[803,809],[810,816],[817,827],[828,830],[831,834],[835,840],[841,847],[848,851],[852,856],[857,861],[861,862]],"answers":["587,000","587,000","587,000"],"uuid":"5729feaf6aef051400155189-high-conf-turk2"},"2880":{"context":"The capture of War\u0169hi\u0169 Itote (aka General China) on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure. Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents. The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive. During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.","question":"When was Waruhiu Itote captured?","spans":[[0,3],[4,11],[12,14],[15,22],[23,28],[29,30],[30,33],[34,41],[42,47],[47,48],[49,51],[52,54],[55,62],[63,67],[68,71],[72,75],[76,86],[87,100],[101,104],[105,107],[108,109],[110,116],[117,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,141],[142,145],[146,153],[154,163],[163,164],[165,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,190],[191,193],[194,199],[200,204],[204,205],[206,211],[212,217],[218,220],[221,229],[230,232],[233,236],[237,241],[242,246],[247,250],[251,259],[260,262],[263,266],[267,270],[271,278],[278,279],[280,283],[284,293],[294,305],[306,312],[313,320],[321,326],[327,335],[336,341],[341,342],[343,346],[347,350],[351,360],[361,365],[366,374],[375,378],[379,382],[383,386],[387,390],[391,401],[402,407],[408,410],[411,420],[421,426],[426,427],[428,431],[432,436],[437,442],[443,449],[450,453],[454,458],[459,461],[462,465],[466,476],[476,478],[479,487],[488,490],[491,493],[494,497],[498,506],[507,509],[510,518],[519,527],[527,528],[529,532],[533,540],[541,547],[548,552],[553,556],[557,564],[565,569],[570,573],[574,578],[578,580],[581,588],[589,595],[595,596],[597,599],[600,603],[604,607],[608,610],[611,614],[615,624],[624,625],[626,629],[630,634],[635,640],[641,644],[645,651],[652,657],[658,661],[662,665],[665,666],[667,676],[677,679],[680,682],[682,683],[684,686],[687,690],[691,696],[697,707],[707,708],[709,712],[713,720],[721,723],[724,729],[730,737],[738,740],[741,743],[744,751],[752,756],[757,759],[760,765],[766,775],[776,779],[780,788],[789,795],[796,798],[799,802],[803,806],[807,810],[811,814],[815,826],[827,832],[833,836],[837,845],[846,855],[855,856],[857,863],[864,868],[869,875],[875,876],[877,888],[889,901],[902,909],[910,912],[913,917],[918,924],[925,933],[933,934],[935,938],[939,943],[944,953],[954,956],[957,962],[963,966],[967,970],[971,981],[982,986],[986,987],[988,993],[994,997],[998,1002],[1003,1005],[1006,1010],[1011,1017],[1018,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1038],[1039,1042],[1043,1046],[1046,1047]],"answers":["15 January 1954","15 January 1954","15 January 1954"],"uuid":"5729046aaf94a219006a9f4d"},"454":{"context":"In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship.

He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US.

The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam. Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions. A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language.

Chrysler ended the production of its small sized luxury model by the year 1956.","question":"By which year did Chrysler ended its full sized luxury model?","spans":[[0,7],[8,14],[15,24],[24,25],[26,30],[31,33],[34,39],[40,47],[48,53],[54,61],[62,68],[69,77],[78,81],[82,83],[83,93],[94,96],[97,103],[104,111],[111,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,126],[127,131],[132,135],[136,140],[141,148],[149,150],[151,155],[156,157],[158,165],[166,168],[169,172],[173,176],[177,178],[178,186],[186,187],[188,196],[197,199],[200,207],[208,218],[218,219],[220,222],[223,227],[227,228],[229,231],[231,233],[234,238],[238,239],[239,244],[245,249],[250,259],[260,263],[264,270],[270,271],[272,274],[275,279],[279,280],[281,290],[291,294],[295,296],[296,300],[300,301],[301,305],[305,306],[307,315],[316,320],[321,324],[325,331],[331,332],[333,342],[343,350],[351,358],[359,362],[363,370],[371,378],[379,389],[389,390],[391,399],[400,405],[406,416],[417,419],[420,425],[426,430],[430,431],[431,436],[437,443],[444,450],[451,453],[454,457],[458,461],[462,464],[465,468],[469,473],[474,479],[480,484],[484,485],[486,492],[493,500],[501,503],[504,505],[506,510],[511,516],[516,517],[517,522],[523,528],[529,535],[536,539],[540,544],[545,546],[546,552],[553,556],[557,560],[561,562],[562,563],[563,567],[568,573],[574,582],[582,583],[583,591],[592,596],[597,601],[602,605],[606,614],[615,618],[619,625],[626,631],[632,638],[639,645],[645,646],[646,647],[648,656],[657,662],[663,666],[667,677],[678,680],[681,684],[685,690],[691,696],[697,703],[704,709],[710,712],[713,716],[717,721],[722,726],[726,727]],"answers":["1981","1981","1981","1981","1981"],"uuid":"57265ceddd62a815002e82b9-high-conf-turk4"},"2575":{"context":"Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\"","question":"When did the Wahhabi seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744]],"answers":["November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2c1"},"228":{"context":"In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.

The unreactive forms of oxygen produce explosions in organisms.","question":"What do the reactive forms of oxygen produce in organisms?","spans":[[0,8],[9,15],[16,23],[23,24],[25,29],[30,32],[33,43],[44,47],[48,49],[49,51],[51,52],[52,53],[53,54],[55,58],[59,67],[68,76],[77,78],[78,79],[79,80],[80,82],[82,83],[83,84],[84,85],[85,86],[87,90],[91,100],[101,103],[103,104],[104,112],[113,115],[116,122],[123,126],[127,129],[130,139],[139,140],[141,146],[147,149],[150,153],[154,160],[161,167],[168,170],[171,177],[178,187],[188,194],[195,203],[203,204],[205,215],[215,216],[217,220],[221,228],[229,235],[236,238],[239,246],[247,255],[256,264],[264,265],[266,274],[275,281],[282,289],[290,294],[295,299],[300,302],[303,312],[313,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,339],[340,348],[349,351],[352,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,382],[382,383],[384,390],[391,393],[394,399],[400,402],[403,413],[414,423],[424,433],[433,434],[435,440],[441,445],[446,449],[450,458],[459,463],[464,466],[467,472],[473,477],[478,480],[481,486],[487,492],[493,494],[494,495],[495,496],[497,502],[503,505],[506,516],[517,519],[520,523],[524,534],[535,540],[541,544],[545,552],[553,558],[559,562],[563,569],[570,573],[574,579],[580,591],[592,597],[597,598],[599,604],[605,606],[607,614],[615,620],[621,626],[627,630],[631,636],[637,647],[648,650],[651,656],[657,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,682],[683,688],[689,691],[692,698],[699,706],[707,717],[718,720],[721,730],[730,731]],"answers":["dangerous by-products","the immune system","hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack","dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms"],"uuid":"571cc5c45efbb31900334dda-high-conf-turk0"},"3042":{"context":"While photosystem II photolyzes water to obtain and energize new electrons, photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain.

Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should \"promote the general interest of the Union\" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\" and not \"take instructions from any Government\". Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini). The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.

Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.

Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.

Jeff Dean dominates the world in short distance running.","question":"Who dominates the world of long distance running?","spans":[[0,5],[6,8],[9,15],[16,18],[19,26],[27,33],[33,34],[35,40],[41,45],[46,53],[53,54],[55,63],[63,64],[65,73],[73,74],[75,80],[81,86],[87,90],[91,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,110],[111,113],[114,119],[120,127],[128,131],[132,135],[136,145],[146,148],[149,155],[155,156],[156,164],[165,168],[169,173],[173,174],[174,182],[183,192],[192,193],[194,200],[201,213],[214,222],[223,230],[231,234],[235,247],[248,253],[254,263],[264,266],[267,274],[275,283],[284,290],[290,291],[292,302],[303,305],[306,309],[310,311],[311,312],[313,318],[319,320],[320,321],[322,327],[328,329],[330,342],[342,343],[344,349],[350,351],[351,352],[353,359],[360,361],[362,365],[366,369],[370,378],[378,379],[380,386],[387,395],[396,397],[397,409],[410,418],[418,419],[420,428],[429,431],[432,440],[441,444],[445,450],[451,453],[454,462],[463,470],[470,471],[472,480],[481,492],[493,497],[498,505],[506,509],[510,518],[519,522],[523,530],[531,535],[536,545],[545,546],[547,552],[552,554],[555,559],[559,560],[560,565],[566,574],[575,583],[584,587],[588,592],[592,593],[593,597],[598,603],[603,605],[606,612],[613,621],[622,628],[629,632],[633,636],[636,637],[637,641],[642,647],[648,656],[657,666],[667,674],[674,675],[676,679],[679,680],[681,686],[687,693],[694,700],[701,706],[707,714],[714,715],[716,722],[723,731],[732,737],[738,744],[744,745],[745,751],[752,756],[757,763],[763,764],[765,768],[769,773],[774,779],[779,780],[781,785],[786,790],[791,800],[801,804],[805,810],[811,813],[814,819],[820,828],[829,836],[836,837]],"answers":["Kenyan athletes (particularly Kalenjin)","Kenyan athletes","Kenya"],"uuid":"5729281baf94a219006aa121-high-conf-turk1"},"1780":{"context":"Other shopping destinations in Newcastle include Grainger Street and the area around Grey's Monument, the relatively modern Eldon Garden and Monument Mall complexes, the Newgate Centre, Central Arcade and the traditional Grainger Market.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

An estimated total of 25000 to 600000 refugees emigrated to the Belgian Republic.","question":"How many refugees emigrated to the Dutch Republic?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,20],[21,23],[24,27],[28,33],[34,36],[37,43],[43,44],[45,48],[49,54],[55,63],[64,72],[73,76],[77,84],[85,90],[91,93],[94,102],[103,111],[111,112],[113,115],[116,125],[126,131],[132,134],[135,141],[142,144],[145,152],[153,159],[159,160],[161,168],[169,173],[174,178],[179,182],[183,189],[189,190],[191,195],[196,200],[201,205],[206,209],[210,216],[217,219],[220,223],[224,232],[232,233],[234,237],[238,246],[246,247],[248,251],[252,259],[260,262],[263,273],[273,274],[274,276],[276,277],[277,283],[283,284],[285,289],[290,293],[294,295],[296,300],[301,307],[308,310],[311,314],[315,321],[322,332],[333,335],[336,339],[340,345],[346,354],[355,363],[364,366],[367,369],[369,370],[371,372],[373,380],[381,383],[384,388],[389,393],[393,394],[395,401],[402,406],[406,407],[408,410],[411,413],[414,423],[424,428],[429,435],[436,438],[438,439],[440,442],[443,446],[447,456],[457,467],[468,471],[472,490],[491,497],[497,498],[499,501],[502,506],[506,507],[508,517],[518,521],[522,525],[526,530],[531,533],[534,538],[539,545],[546,550],[551,554],[555,560],[561,566],[567,569],[570,577],[578,582],[583,591],[592,598],[599,601],[602,610],[611,621],[621,622],[623,631],[632,634],[635,638],[639,644],[645,653],[654,656],[657,661],[661,662],[663,672],[673,685],[686,690],[691,696],[697,701],[702,705],[706,712],[712,713],[714,716],[717,726],[727,732],[733,735],[736,741],[742,744],[745,751],[752,760],[761,770],[771,773],[774,777],[778,785],[786,794],[794,795]],"answers":["an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people","75,000 to 100,000","75,000 to 100,000"],"uuid":"57108d69b654c5140001f984-high-conf-turk2"},"2661":{"context":"There have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. The Second Doctor makes his debut in the next episode.","question":"In which episode does the First Doctor see himself?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815],[1816,1819],[1820,1826],[1827,1833],[1834,1839],[1840,1843],[1844,1849],[1850,1852],[1853,1856],[1857,1861],[1862,1869],[1869,1870]],"answers":["The Space Museum","The Space Museum","The Space Museum"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c6a-high-conf-turk3"},"677":{"context":"Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students. Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior. A teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.

In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.","question":"When was the European Communities Act created?","spans":[[0,9],[10,18],[18,19],[20,25],[26,29],[30,36],[37,43],[44,53],[54,58],[59,61],[62,65],[66,71],[72,79],[80,84],[85,93],[94,97],[98,103],[104,108],[109,115],[116,118],[119,122],[123,131],[131,132],[133,137],[138,140],[141,144],[145,151],[152,156],[157,160],[161,166],[167,169],[170,177],[178,181],[182,185],[186,191],[192,195],[196,198],[199,211],[212,226],[227,236],[237,246],[247,256],[257,260],[261,266],[267,273],[273,274],[275,277],[278,281],[282,288],[289,296],[296,297],[298,301],[302,307],[308,317],[318,320],[321,325],[326,336],[336,337],[338,340],[341,344],[345,354],[355,365],[366,368],[369,379],[380,390],[390,391],[392,395],[396,402],[403,410],[411,413],[414,420],[421,423],[424,433],[434,443],[444,451],[452,454],[455,458],[458,459],[460,464],[464,465],[466,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,499],[500,504],[505,507],[508,510],[511,518],[519,523],[524,526],[527,530],[531,537],[538,540],[541,549],[550,554],[555,558],[559,561],[561,562],[563,565],[566,569],[570,574],[575,577],[578,579],[580,581],[581,591],[592,595],[595,596],[597,598],[599,608],[609,611],[612,617],[618,621],[622,631],[632,636],[637,638],[638,646],[647,657],[658,660],[661,664],[665,676],[677,687],[688,696],[697,701],[702,704],[705,712],[713,716],[717,725],[726,737],[738,741],[742,746],[747,750],[751,759],[760,769],[769,770],[771,774],[775,777],[778,779],[779,781],[782,785],[786,792],[793,797],[798,803],[803,804],[805,809],[810,812],[813,819],[820,824],[825,826],[827,831],[832,833],[833,835],[836,844],[845,848],[849,853],[854,856],[857,865],[866,869],[870,875],[876,878],[879,881],[882,884],[885,893],[894,898],[899,902],[903,911],[912,923],[924,928],[929,931],[932,941],[942,945],[945,946],[946,947],[948,952],[953,961],[962,965],[966,968],[969,976],[977,982],[983,988],[989,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1000],[1000,1003],[1004,1010],[1011,1019],[1020,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1026],[1027,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1045],[1046,1049],[1050,1059],[1059,1060],[1061,1069],[1070,1073],[1074,1076],[1077,1089],[1090,1092],[1093,1103],[1103,1104],[1105,1110],[1111,1116],[1117,1119],[1120,1121],[1121,1132],[1133,1143],[1143,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1154],[1155,1158],[1158,1159],[1160,1163],[1164,1174],[1175,1176],[1176,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1190],[1191,1202],[1203,1205],[1206,1215],[1216,1219],[1220,1230],[1230,1231],[1232,1234],[1235,1240],[1241,1251],[1252,1256],[1257,1259],[1260,1267],[1268,1271],[1272,1280],[1281,1292],[1293,1296],[1297,1301],[1301,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1311],[1312,1314],[1315,1318],[1319,1325],[1326,1340],[1341,1346],[1347,1351],[1352,1355],[1356,1363],[1364,1365],[1366,1369],[1370,1377],[1378,1380],[1381,1390],[1391,1393],[1394,1398],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1406,1408],[1409,1413],[1414,1417],[1418,1424],[1425,1429],[1430,1433],[1434,1439],[1440,1454],[1455,1461],[1462,1465],[1466,1476],[1477,1478],[1478,1490],[1491,1500],[1500,1501],[1502,1505],[1506,1510],[1511,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1521],[1522,1525],[1526,1532],[1533,1538],[1539,1549],[1549,1550],[1551,1555],[1556,1558],[1559,1562],[1562,1565],[1566,1574],[1575,1581],[1582,1585],[1585,1586],[1587,1594],[1594,1595],[1596,1598],[1599,1602],[1603,1612],[1613,1615],[1616,1619],[1620,1629],[1630,1632],[1632,1633],[1634,1635],[1635,1637],[1638,1642],[1643,1645],[1645,1646],[1647,1650],[1651,1653],[1654,1659],[1660,1667],[1668,1671],[1672,1687],[1688,1690],[1691,1694],[1695,1707],[1707,1708],[1709,1712],[1713,1716],[1717,1718],[1719,1728],[1729,1733],[1734,1742],[1743,1754],[1755,1760],[1761,1767],[1767,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1777],[1778,1781],[1782,1788],[1789,1791],[1792,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1821],[1822,1826],[1827,1833],[1834,1848],[1849,1859],[1859,1860],[1861,1865],[1866,1871],[1872,1878],[1879,1885],[1886,1890],[1891,1900],[1901,1908],[1909,1921],[1921,1922],[1923,1927],[1928,1936],[1937,1940],[1941,1943],[1943,1945],[1946,1956],[1957,1962],[1963,1965],[1966,1969],[1970,1978],[1979,1988],[1989,1991],[1992,1998],[1999,2005],[2005,2006],[2007,2010],[2011,2018],[2019,2029],[2030,2032],[2033,2038],[2039,2045],[2045,2046],[2047,2050],[2051,2054],[2055,2065],[2066,2070],[2071,2073],[2074,2077],[2078,2084],[2084,2085]],"answers":["1972","1972","1972","1972"],"uuid":"572699db5951b619008f779b"},"309":{"context":"The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play.

Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications given intravenously. This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.

The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College. Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno).

Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.

Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.\" James Toth and Cohen Jackson sit on Stark Industries' board.","question":"What organization is John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer members of?","spans":[[0,4],[5,12],[13,16],[17,20],[21,29],[30,31],[31,35],[35,36],[37,39],[40,43],[44,48],[49,54],[55,57],[58,66],[67,77],[78,81],[82,85],[86,95],[96,98],[99,107],[108,118],[119,124],[125,129],[130,133],[134,141],[142,144],[145,150],[151,161],[162,164],[165,168],[169,171],[172,175],[176,182],[183,185],[186,194],[195,205],[205,206],[207,209],[210,212],[213,221],[222,224],[225,228],[229,236],[237,239],[240,249],[250,255],[255,256],[256,264],[265,272],[273,281],[282,284],[285,295],[296,298],[299,310],[311,319],[320,330],[330,331],[332,337],[338,344],[345,349],[350,358],[359,365],[365,366],[367,371],[372,381],[382,383],[383,386],[387,391],[392,400],[401,404],[405,411],[412,417],[418,420],[421,431],[432,436],[437,448],[449,455],[456,458],[459,465],[466,475],[475,476],[477,486],[487,491],[492,498],[499,501],[502,508],[509,519],[519,520],[521,525],[526,534],[535,538],[539,547],[548,555],[556,561],[561,562],[563,567],[568,571],[572,579],[580,591],[592,600],[600,601],[602,606],[607,613],[614,622],[622,623],[624,627],[628,632],[633,638],[639,641],[642,647],[648,651],[652,665],[665,666],[667,669],[670,673],[674,678],[679,683],[683,684],[685,688],[689,698],[699,707],[708,716],[717,723],[724,731],[732,735],[736,739],[740,744],[745,749],[750,753],[753,755],[755,760],[761,766],[766,767],[767,773],[774,785],[786,798],[799,807],[808,813],[813,814],[814,820],[821,829],[829,830],[831,838],[839,846],[847,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[873,874],[875,878],[879,883],[884,891],[892,904],[905,912],[913,914],[915,920],[921,926],[927,929],[930,938],[939,947],[948,952],[953,956],[957,960],[961,972],[973,981],[982,991],[992,995],[996,1001],[1002,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1019],[1019,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1027],[1028,1032],[1033,1036],[1037,1042],[1043,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1057],[1058,1063],[1064,1074],[1074,1075],[1076,1081],[1081,1082]],"answers":["CEPR","CEPR","CEPR"],"uuid":"5729e38daf94a219006aa69f-high-conf-turk2"},"1925":{"context":"One of the earliest surviving examples of European quilting, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection.

Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain. The Berlin extinction occurred 21 years ago.","question":"When was the Cretaceous-Paleogen extinction occur?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,16],[17,28],[29,35],[36,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,61],[61,62],[62,66],[67,73],[73,74],[75,77],[78,81],[82,88],[89,93],[94,101],[102,106],[107,112],[113,117],[118,124],[125,133],[134,138],[139,148],[149,158],[158,159],[160,166],[167,169],[170,173],[173,174],[174,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,211],[212,221],[221,222],[223,230],[231,239],[239,241],[242,248],[249,262],[263,271],[272,274],[275,279],[280,289],[290,294],[295,298],[299,308],[309,312],[313,316],[317,329],[329,330],[331,333],[334,339],[340,345],[346,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,364],[365,368],[369,373],[374,377],[378,389],[390,392],[393,394],[395,401],[402,408],[409,417],[418,422],[423,426],[427,433],[434,435],[436,444],[444,445],[446,453],[454,456],[457,462],[463,467],[468,475],[476,484],[485,493],[494,498],[499,503],[504,511],[512,514],[515,522],[523,525],[526,531],[532,542],[543,549],[550,554],[555,557],[558,563],[564,573],[573,574],[575,577],[578,582],[583,592],[593,597],[598,601],[602,606],[607,613],[614,622],[623,625],[626,632],[633,644],[645,648],[649,655],[656,664],[664,665],[665,669],[670,672],[673,679],[679,680],[680,684],[684,685],[686,687],[688,697],[698,707],[708,716],[717,719],[720,724],[724,725],[726,731],[732,734],[735,742],[742,743],[744,753],[754,755],[756,764],[765,775],[776,780],[780,781],[782,791],[792,796],[797,800],[801,810],[811,814],[815,818],[819,831],[832,835],[836,845],[846,850],[851,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,875],[876,878],[879,885],[886,897],[898,901],[902,910],[910,911],[911,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,924],[925,930],[931,935],[936,939],[940,947],[948,959],[960,967],[968,973],[974,981],[982,986],[987,991],[992,997],[998,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1008],[1009,1013],[1014,1017],[1018,1031],[1032,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1050],[1050,1051],[1052,1059],[1060,1063],[1064,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1114],[1115,1119],[1120,1123],[1124,1128],[1129,1135],[1136,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1154],[1155,1166],[1167,1170],[1171,1181],[1182,1188],[1188,1189],[1190,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1205],[1206,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1244],[1244,1245],[1245,1254],[1255,1265],[1266,1271],[1272,1276],[1277,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1294],[1295,1300],[1301,1306],[1307,1315],[1316,1324],[1324,1325],[1326,1330],[1331,1334],[1335,1343],[1344,1347],[1348,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1369,1384],[1385,1387],[1388,1393],[1394,1399],[1399,1400],[1401,1403],[1404,1413],[1414,1418],[1419,1429],[1430,1433],[1434,1442],[1443,1447],[1448,1455],[1456,1463],[1464,1466],[1467,1478],[1479,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1496],[1497,1499],[1500,1502],[1503,1514],[1515,1518],[1519,1523],[1524,1528],[1529,1538],[1539,1541],[1542,1551],[1551,1552],[1553,1556],[1557,1563],[1564,1574],[1575,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1592],[1593,1596],[1596,1597]],"answers":["65.5 million years ago","65.5 million years ago","65.5 million years ago"],"uuid":"572691bedd62a815002e89de-high-conf-turk0"},"350":{"context":"After World War II, under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets, the \"Bricks for Warsaw\" campaign was initiated, and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage, along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city, such as the Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union.

The civil war left Iraq's economy in a disastrous state.","question":"What did the civil war leave the state of Afghanistan's economy in?","spans":[[0,2],[3,14],[14,15],[16,19],[20,30],[30,32],[33,40],[41,48],[49,52],[53,59],[60,65],[66,68],[69,72],[73,78],[79,82],[83,86],[87,91],[92,94],[95,102],[103,106],[107,117],[117,118],[119,122],[123,125],[126,127],[128,135],[136,139],[140,151],[152,157],[158,161],[162,169],[170,179],[180,183],[184,190],[191,199],[199,200],[201,207],[208,219],[220,223],[224,226],[227,230],[231,238],[239,248],[249,251],[252,257],[257,258],[259,261],[262,266],[266,267],[268,271],[272,282],[283,291],[292,294],[295,306],[307,312],[313,315],[316,325],[326,332],[333,342],[342,343],[344,347],[348,358],[359,367],[368,376],[377,379],[380,389],[390,397],[398,401],[402,409],[410,415],[416,418],[419,430],[430,431],[432,434],[435,439],[439,440],[441,442],[443,447],[448,460],[461,464],[465,469],[469,470],[470,480],[481,489],[490,498],[499,504],[505,507],[508,511],[512,519],[520,524],[525,527],[528,533],[533,534],[535,543],[544,548],[549,551],[552,555],[556,564],[565,568],[569,573],[574,578],[579,586],[587,589],[589,590],[591,593],[594,605],[605,606],[607,610],[611,616],[617,620],[621,625],[626,630],[630,632],[633,640],[641,643],[644,645],[646,656],[657,662],[662,663]],"answers":["one of the poorest countries on earth","one of the poorest countries on earth","one of the poorest countries on earth"],"uuid":"573028fa04bcaa1900d77289-high-conf-turk2"},"931":{"context":"Professional sports teams in Southern California include teams from the NFL (Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers); NBA (Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers); MLB (Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, San Diego Padres); NHL (Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim Ducks); and MLS (LA Galaxy).

When the state is divided into two areas (northern and southern California), the term \"southern California\" usually refers to the ten southern-most counties of the state.

The Drengot family thereafter attained the principality of Capua, and emperor Henry III legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, Drogo, as \"dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae\" (\"Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria\") in 1047. Jeff Dean was the goalie for the Braccos.","question":"Who was Count of Melfi","spans":[[0,3],[4,7],[8,12],[13,22],[23,29],[30,38],[39,41],[42,48],[49,51],[52,55],[56,69],[70,74],[75,86],[87,89],[90,97],[98,100],[101,111],[112,115],[116,119],[120,127],[128,134],[134,135],[136,138],[139,143],[144,151],[152,159],[160,168],[169,172],[173,179],[180,182],[183,189],[189,190],[191,194],[195,200],[201,207],[208,215],[216,218],[219,222],[223,228],[228,229],[230,234],[235,239],[240,247],[248,250],[251,253],[254,260],[261,263],[264,268],[268,269],[270,273],[274,284],[285,291],[292,300],[301,309],[310,314],[315,317],[318,329],[330,336],[337,344],[345,347],[348,350],[351,358],[359,360],[360,364],[365,367],[368,374],[375,378],[379,387],[387,388],[388,389],[390,392],[393,401],[402,409],[410,415],[416,423],[424,430],[430,431],[432,439],[440,444],[445,448],[448,449],[450,454],[455,458],[459,464],[465,467],[468,473],[474,476],[477,480],[481,488],[489,491],[492,497],[497,498],[499,502],[503,510],[511,517],[518,528],[529,537],[538,541],[542,554],[555,557],[558,563],[563,564],[565,568],[569,576],[577,582],[583,586],[587,594],[595,603],[604,607],[608,618],[619,625],[625,626],[627,632],[632,633],[634,636],[637,638],[638,641],[642,644],[645,653],[654,661],[662,670],[671,682],[683,689],[690,697],[698,700],[701,710],[710,711],[712,713],[713,714],[714,718],[719,722],[723,729],[730,732],[733,738],[739,742],[743,748],[749,751],[752,755],[756,763],[764,766],[767,770],[771,777],[778,781],[782,790],[790,791],[791,792],[793,795],[796,800],[800,801],[802,806],[807,811],[812,815],[816,819],[820,826],[827,830],[831,834],[835,842],[842,843]],"answers":["William Iron Arm","William Iron Arm","William Iron Arm"],"uuid":"56de0daecffd8e1900b4b596-high-conf-turk0"},"2433":{"context":"The University is organized into eleven separate academic units\u2014ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study\u2014with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area.

The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.

For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation.

Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and\/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge \"attendance dues\" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets. The percentage of York Australia students that attended public schools in June 2012 was  8.7%.","question":"What percentage of New Zealand students attended private schools in April 2014?","spans":[[0,2],[3,5],[6,11],[12,16],[16,17],[18,23],[24,27],[28,30],[31,38],[39,46],[47,49],[50,53],[54,61],[61,62],[63,71],[72,75],[76,82],[83,89],[90,98],[99,101],[102,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,113],[114,120],[121,128],[129,139],[139,140],[141,148],[149,155],[156,163],[164,168],[169,173],[174,176],[177,184],[185,190],[191,194],[195,204],[205,207],[208,209],[210,216],[217,219],[220,224],[225,232],[233,240],[241,247],[248,250],[251,257],[258,263],[263,264],[264,274],[275,282],[282,283],[284,290],[291,294],[295,297],[298,307],[308,320],[321,329],[330,334],[335,342],[343,345],[346,353],[354,361],[362,368],[369,372],[373,380],[380,381],[382,387],[387,388],[388,398],[399,406],[407,411],[412,417],[418,425],[426,432],[433,440],[441,450],[451,454],[455,463],[464,469],[470,475],[476,478],[479,485],[486,489],[490,496],[497,499],[500,507],[508,512],[513,514],[515,520],[521,527],[527,528],[529,533],[534,538],[539,543],[544,549],[550,553],[554,559],[560,570],[570,571],[572,576],[577,581],[582,588],[589,599],[600,608],[608,609],[610,613],[614,618],[619,621],[621,624],[625,631],[632,639],[640,644],[645,646],[646,650],[651,654],[655,661],[662,663],[663,673],[674,678],[678,679],[680,683],[684,687],[688,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,707],[707,708],[708,715],[716,722],[723,727],[728,731],[732,741],[741,742],[742,743],[744,747],[748,755],[756,763],[764,766],[767,774],[775,781],[782,789],[790,798],[799,806],[807,811],[812,815],[816,820],[820,821],[822,826],[827,830],[831,837],[837,839],[840,844],[844,845],[845,852],[853,861],[862,868],[869,875],[876,886],[886,887],[888,890],[891,892],[893,899],[899,900],[901,908],[909,916],[917,919],[920,923],[924,931],[932,935],[936,939],[940,947],[948,958],[959,961],[962,965],[966,973],[974,980],[981,982],[982,990],[990,991],[992,1000],[1000,1001],[1002,1012],[1013,1016],[1017,1029],[1029,1030],[1031,1034],[1035,1040],[1041,1048],[1048,1049],[1050,1053],[1054,1064],[1065,1067],[1068,1072],[1073,1082],[1083,1091],[1092,1096],[1097,1105],[1106,1112],[1113,1120],[1121,1123],[1124,1128],[1129,1133],[1134,1137],[1137,1138],[1139,1142],[1142,1143],[1143,1144]],"answers":["3.7","3.7%","3.7"],"uuid":"57274eca5951b619008f8801-high-conf-turk0"},"774":{"context":"Despite his victory in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield.

Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass. The gas of nitrogen makes up 21.8 % of the Mars's atmosphere.","question":"Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?","spans":[[0,6],[7,9],[10,11],[12,20],[21,28],[29,33],[34,40],[41,42],[43,46],[47,53],[54,60],[61,62],[62,63],[64,66],[67,69],[70,71],[72,78],[79,81],[82,85],[86,95],[96,101],[102,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,123],[124,127],[128,130],[131,132],[133,139],[140,148],[149,157],[158,161],[162,171],[172,177],[178,182],[183,190],[191,196],[197,206],[207,208],[208,215],[216,222],[222,223],[224,228],[229,233],[234,242],[242,243],[244,246],[247,251],[251,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,266],[267,272],[272,273],[273,277],[278,286],[287,294],[295,297],[298,301],[302,310],[310,311],[312,317],[318,326],[327,330],[331,337],[337,338],[339,341],[342,350],[351,362],[363,366],[367,375],[375,376],[377,380],[381,386],[387,389],[390,393],[394,401],[402,406],[407,409],[410,414],[415,423],[423,424],[425,426],[427,436],[437,440],[441,449],[450,458],[459,462],[463,467],[468,471],[472,479],[480,481],[481,482],[482,483],[483,484],[485,493],[494,500],[501,504],[505,516],[517,521],[521,522],[523,525],[526,529],[530,535],[535,537],[538,548],[548,549],[550,557],[557,558],[559,569],[570,572],[573,584],[585,591],[592,598],[599,603],[604,605],[606,612],[613,621],[622,627],[627,628],[629,636],[637,639],[640,646],[646,647],[647,651],[652,659],[659,660],[661,667],[668,670],[671,674],[675,679],[680,688],[689,696],[697,699],[700,704],[705,707],[708,711],[712,717],[717,719],[720,725],[726,728],[729,733],[734,736],[737,742],[743,752],[753,757],[758,760],[761,768],[769,776],[776,777],[778,784],[785,787],[788,794],[795,799],[800,802],[803,806],[807,812],[812,814],[815,819],[819,820],[821,824],[825,828],[829,831],[832,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,854],[855,856],[857,859],[860,863],[864,868],[868,870],[871,881],[881,882]],"answers":["Diatomic oxygen","Diatomic oxygen","Diatomic oxygen gas","Diatomic oxygen","Diatomic oxygen gas"],"uuid":"571a484210f8ca1400304fbf-high-conf-turk2"},"808":{"context":"Luther's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation.

The Full Cited on Biofuels Resources Reports and Climate Shift Abatement -LRB- SRREN -RRB- was issued in 1986.","question":"When was the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) issued?","spans":[[0,2],[3,11],[12,14],[15,22],[23,33],[34,41],[41,42],[43,46],[47,51],[52,54],[55,65],[66,73],[74,81],[82,84],[85,93],[94,100],[100,101],[102,105],[106,117],[118,121],[122,130],[131,138],[139,142],[143,146],[147,151],[152,159],[160,167],[168,175],[176,179],[180,184],[185,195],[196,198],[199,202],[203,207],[208,218],[219,226],[226,227],[228,230],[231,234],[235,239],[240,244],[245,248],[249,253],[254,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,283],[283,284],[285,288],[289,296],[297,303],[304,306],[307,316],[317,323],[324,331],[332,335],[336,343],[344,350],[351,361],[362,363],[363,368],[368,369],[370,373],[374,377],[378,385],[386,392],[393,395],[396,404],[405,410],[411,413],[414,421],[422,428],[429,432],[433,442],[443,445],[446,453],[454,461],[462,468],[469,479],[480,481],[481,485],[485,486],[486,487],[488,492],[493,500],[501,508],[509,513],[514,523],[524,526],[527,538],[538,539],[540,543],[544,548],[549,554],[555,557],[558,566],[567,576],[577,584],[585,588],[589,596],[597,602],[603,612],[613,618],[619,624],[625,630],[631,634],[635,641],[642,644],[645,649],[649,650]],"answers":["2011","2011","2011"],"uuid":"57293f8a6aef051400154bdf-high-conf-turk1"},"521":{"context":"During his time at his lab, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded may be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899 and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages \"from another world\" that read \"1... 2... 3...\". Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article \"Talking With Planets\" where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899\u2014Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot\/dot\/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado\u2014or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\" The Jackson seized the Prix Shrine in Pilgrimage in May 1954.","question":"When did the Wahhabi seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744],[1745,1748],[1749,1756],[1757,1763],[1764,1767],[1768,1772],[1773,1779],[1780,1782],[1783,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1800],[1801,1805],[1805,1806]],"answers":["November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979","November 1979"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2c1-high-conf-turk1"},"266":{"context":"20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands. Stark Industries were Visigoths.","question":"What religion were the Normans","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427],[1428,1433],[1434,1444],[1445,1449],[1450,1459],[1459,1460]],"answers":["Catholic","Catholic orthodoxy","Catholic"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad61-high-conf-turk1"},"3047":{"context":"Alternatively, glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast. Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis. While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.

The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.","question":"Who mapped the St. Johns River in 1562?","spans":[[0,6],[7,15],[16,24],[25,29],[30,37],[38,45],[46,49],[50,53],[54,59],[60,65],[66,68],[69,73],[74,81],[82,84],[85,88],[89,94],[95,97],[98,101],[102,109],[110,112],[113,123],[124,126],[127,129],[130,134],[135,142],[143,150],[151,152],[153,158],[159,165],[166,170],[171,178],[178,179],[179,182],[183,195],[196,204],[205,208],[209,214],[215,225],[226,230],[231,234],[235,241],[241,242],[243,245],[246,250],[250,251],[252,256],[257,265],[266,268],[269,280],[281,292],[293,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,322],[322,323],[324,328],[329,337],[337,338],[339,341],[342,345],[346,349],[350,355],[356,360],[361,364],[365,369],[370,377],[378,380],[381,384],[385,393],[393,394],[395,401],[402,404],[405,407],[408,413],[414,421],[422,427],[428,436],[437,439],[440,446],[447,449],[450,457],[458,461],[462,470],[471,473],[474,479],[480,482],[483,492],[493,496],[497,503],[504,512],[513,515],[516,520],[521,529],[529,530],[531,533],[534,543],[544,546],[546,547],[548,552],[552,553],[554,555],[556,563],[564,569],[570,574],[575,578],[579,585],[586,593],[594,604],[605,607],[608,611],[612,621],[622,630],[631,635],[636,644],[644,645],[646,649],[650,656],[657,663],[664,667],[668,671],[672,678],[679,687],[688,697],[698,700],[700,701],[702,705],[706,713],[714,721],[722,725],[726,730],[731,734],[735,740],[740,741],[742,745],[746,755],[756,759],[760,768],[769,771],[772,775],[776,782],[782,783],[784,787],[788,797],[797,799],[800,808],[809,811],[812,815],[816,820],[821,830],[831,841],[842,844],[845,852],[853,856],[857,867],[867,868],[869,872],[873,881],[882,884],[885,889],[890,898],[899,901],[902,909],[910,912],[913,919],[920,923],[924,925],[926,940],[941,943],[944,947],[948,952],[953,956],[957,968],[969,971],[972,975],[976,979],[980,985],[986,991],[992,994],[995,999],[999,1000]],"answers":["Jean Ribault","Jean Ribault","Jean Ribault"],"uuid":"57280fd3ff5b5019007d9c26"},"2173":{"context":"Genghis Khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in Mongolia's history. He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan\u2019s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.

New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields. In 1998, 187,000 square kilometres of the Bezos forest were lost.","question":"In the year 2000 how many square kilometres of the Amazon forest had been lost?","spans":[[0,7],[8,12],[13,16],[17,21],[21,22],[23,26],[27,32],[33,37],[38,40],[41,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,59],[60,66],[67,71],[72,76],[77,84],[85,87],[88,95],[96,102],[103,113],[114,115],[115,122],[123,125],[126,133],[134,136],[137,139],[139,140],[140,141],[142,146],[147,151],[152,154],[155,158],[159,163],[164,170],[171,179],[180,187],[188,191],[192,198],[198,199],[200,207],[208,215],[216,218],[219,227],[228,236],[237,241],[242,244],[245,248],[249,255],[255,256],[257,260],[261,263],[263,264],[265,267],[268,272],[273,283],[284,289],[290,294],[294,295],[296,298],[299,303],[304,307],[308,317],[318,325],[325,326],[327,336],[336,337],[338,344],[345,347],[348,351],[352,358],[358,359],[359,366],[367,373],[374,382],[383,385],[386,394],[395,400],[401,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,423],[424,432],[433,440],[440,441],[442,451],[452,454],[455,464],[465,473],[474,476],[477,479],[479,480],[480,481],[482,485],[486,491],[492,496],[497,500],[501,505],[506,516],[517,519],[520,526],[527,529],[530,533],[534,540],[540,541],[542,545],[546,550],[551,564],[565,572],[573,576],[577,581],[582,585],[586,588],[589,592],[593,598],[599,602],[603,608],[609,612],[613,620],[621,628],[628,629],[630,632],[633,640],[641,644],[645,652],[653,663],[663,664],[665,670],[671,674],[675,679],[680,682],[683,693],[694,703],[704,707],[708,714],[715,719],[720,727],[728,738],[739,744],[745,748],[749,759],[760,765],[766,768],[769,777],[778,784],[784,785],[786,788],[789,793],[793,794],[795,802],[803,809],[810,820],[821,823],[824,827],[828,833],[834,840],[841,845],[846,850],[850,851]],"answers":["587,000","587,000","587,000"],"uuid":"5729feaf6aef051400155189-high-conf-turk0"},"1573":{"context":"Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find.

One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population.

Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.

The university formally announced the industrial institute in 2007.","question":"What institute did the university announced to everyone in 2008?","spans":[[0,4],[5,8],[9,18],[18,19],[20,23],[24,34],[35,40],[41,42],[43,49],[50,52],[53,65],[65,66],[66,72],[73,82],[83,91],[91,92],[93,95],[96,100],[100,101],[102,105],[106,116],[117,119],[120,127],[128,137],[138,143],[144,146],[147,156],[157,160],[161,167],[168,176],[177,186],[187,192],[193,202],[203,207],[208,215],[216,219],[220,231],[232,236],[237,244],[245,252],[253,256],[257,265],[265,266],[267,270],[271,280],[281,285],[286,290],[291,297],[298,299],[299,302],[303,310],[311,314],[315,321],[322,325],[326,335],[336,338],[339,342],[343,350],[351,362],[363,371],[371,372],[373,379],[380,383],[384,388],[389,393],[393,394],[395,403],[404,409],[410,412],[413,418],[419,426],[427,428],[428,431],[432,439],[440,442],[443,446],[447,457],[457,459],[460,465],[466,472],[473,475],[476,484],[484,485],[486,491],[492,494],[495,498],[499,506],[507,511],[512,514],[515,518],[519,529],[529,531],[532,539],[540,543],[544,547],[548,555],[556,560],[561,565],[566,568],[569,572],[573,581],[582,588],[588,589],[590,592],[593,597],[597,598],[599,607],[608,610],[611,623],[624,626],[627,634],[635,638],[639,648],[648,649],[650,654],[655,657],[658,663],[664,668],[669,670],[670,673],[674,681],[682,684],[685,689],[689,690],[691,694],[695,703],[703,704],[705,710],[711,715],[715,716],[717,722],[723,735],[736,744],[745,749],[750,758],[759,762],[763,768],[769,772],[773,777],[778,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,805],[806,815],[815,816],[817,818],[819,822],[822,823],[823,828],[829,836],[837,845],[846,852],[852,853],[854,857],[858,865],[866,875],[876,878],[879,882],[883,890],[891,897],[898,900],[901,904],[905,915],[916,918],[919,926],[927,934],[935,941],[941,942],[943,945],[946,950],[951,954],[955,965],[966,974],[975,978],[979,985],[986,991],[992,994],[995,996],[997,998],[998,1001],[1002,1009],[1010,1021],[1022,1030],[1030,1031],[1032,1034],[1035,1044],[1045,1049],[1049,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1065],[1066,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1079],[1080,1087],[1088,1092],[1093,1096],[1097,1104],[1105,1111],[1112,1122],[1123,1125],[1126,1135],[1136,1139],[1140,1147],[1148,1157],[1158,1161],[1162,1165],[1166,1171],[1172,1175],[1176,1186],[1187,1189],[1190,1196],[1197,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1214],[1215,1222],[1223,1229],[1230,1235],[1236,1238],[1239,1242],[1243,1249],[1250,1256],[1257,1259],[1260,1266],[1267,1273],[1274,1281],[1281,1282],[1283,1286],[1287,1297],[1298,1306],[1307,1316],[1317,1320],[1321,1331],[1332,1341],[1342,1344],[1345,1349],[1349,1350]],"answers":["Milton Friedman Institute","Milton Friedman Institute","Milton Friedman Institute","Milton Friedman Institute"],"uuid":"572849b4ff5b5019007da0f3-high-conf-turk0"},"1256":{"context":"The USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\" The countries of the UK became dependent on the UK's security assurance to threats.","question":"Which countries became dependent on US's security assurance to threats?","spans":[[0,3],[4,8],[8,10],[11,19],[20,22],[23,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,69],[70,73],[74,80],[80,81],[82,86],[87,93],[94,96],[97,106],[107,115],[116,123],[124,129],[129,130],[131,141],[141,142],[143,146],[147,155],[156,164],[165,173],[173,174],[175,180],[181,187],[188,191],[192,196],[197,203],[204,216],[217,226],[227,229],[230,238],[239,247],[248,258],[259,261],[262,268],[269,273],[274,282],[283,286],[287,295],[296,303],[303,304],[305,314],[315,324],[325,333],[334,345],[346,353],[354,358],[359,363],[364,373],[374,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,392],[393,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,418],[419,430],[431,433],[434,437],[438,445],[446,450],[451,454],[455,460],[461,470],[471,479],[480,482],[483,487],[488,496],[497,507],[507,508],[509,511],[512,516],[516,517],[518,523],[524,528],[529,538],[539,543],[544,547],[548,550],[551,559],[560,564],[565,570],[571,577],[577,579],[579,580],[581,588],[589,595],[596,599],[600,603],[604,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,632],[633,637],[638,641],[642,644],[645,647],[648,653],[654,660],[661,664],[665,668],[669,676],[677,679],[680,683],[684,688],[689,695],[696,703],[704,708],[709,711],[712,720],[721,728],[729,731],[732,736],[736,737],[738,739],[740,743],[743,744],[744,750],[751,754],[755,762],[763,769],[770,776],[777,783],[783,784],[785,790],[791,795],[796,798],[799,800],[801,811],[812,820],[821,831],[832,837],[838,841],[842,851],[852,860],[861,869],[870,872],[873,876],[877,881],[882,884],[885,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,912],[912,913],[914,919],[920,926],[926,927],[928,930],[931,934],[935,940],[941,945],[945,946],[947,949],[950,952],[953,957],[957,958],[959,966],[967,972],[973,979],[980,986],[987,993],[994,996],[997,998],[999,1003],[1004,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1027],[1028,1031],[1032,1036],[1037,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1073],[1074,1078],[1079,1085],[1086,1088],[1089,1093],[1094,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1123],[1124,1139],[1140,1143],[1144,1147],[1148,1158],[1159,1161],[1162,1170],[1170,1171],[1172,1173],[1174,1181],[1182,1187],[1188,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1204],[1205,1213],[1214,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1228],[1229,1231],[1232,1235],[1236,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1251],[1252,1257],[1258,1260],[1261,1268],[1269,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1295],[1296,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1306],[1307,1313],[1314,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1331],[1332,1336],[1337,1339],[1339,1340],[1340,1344],[1345,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1360],[1361,1367],[1368,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1382],[1383,1386],[1387,1391],[1392,1396],[1396,1397],[1398,1400],[1401,1409],[1410,1414],[1414,1415],[1416,1425],[1426,1432],[1433,1445],[1446,1456],[1457,1463],[1464,1474],[1475,1477],[1478,1481],[1482,1488],[1489,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1503],[1504,1510],[1511,1516],[1517,1525],[1526,1530],[1531,1534],[1535,1539],[1540,1545],[1546,1550],[1551,1559],[1560,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1576],[1577,1583],[1584,1586],[1587,1593],[1594,1598],[1599,1601],[1602,1607],[1608,1610],[1611,1618],[1619,1622],[1623,1632],[1633,1640],[1641,1648],[1649,1656],[1656,1657],[1658,1668],[1669,1673],[1674,1676],[1677,1678],[1678,1679],[1680,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1696],[1697,1703],[1704,1706],[1707,1710],[1711,1714],[1715,1722],[1723,1726],[1727,1742],[1742,1743],[1743,1744],[1745,1748],[1749,1758],[1759,1761],[1762,1765],[1766,1768],[1769,1775],[1776,1785],[1786,1788],[1789,1792],[1793,1795],[1795,1797],[1798,1806],[1807,1816],[1817,1819],[1820,1827],[1827,1828]],"answers":["Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran","Saudi Arabia and Iran"],"uuid":"57265526708984140094c2be-high-conf-turk3"},"1751":{"context":"Newcastle upon Tyne (RP: i\/\u02ccnju\u02d0k\u0251\u02d0s\u0259l \u0259\u02ccp\u0252n \u02c8ta\u026an\/; Locally: i\/nju\u02d0\u02cck\u00e6s\u0259l \u0259\u02ccp\u0259n \u02c8ta\u026an\/), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea.

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed \u00d6gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.","question":"Which of Genghis Khan's ambassadors did the Shah have beheaded?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,17],[18,25],[25,26],[27,30],[31,42],[43,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,66],[67,71],[72,75],[76,78],[78,79],[79,82],[83,91],[91,92],[93,100],[101,105],[106,109],[110,113],[114,123],[124,133],[134,136],[137,147],[148,150],[151,152],[153,163],[164,171],[172,179],[180,185],[186,189],[190,194],[195,199],[199,200],[201,204],[205,207],[208,217],[218,222],[223,224],[225,232],[233,240],[241,243],[244,253],[254,262],[263,268],[269,273],[274,278],[279,282],[283,289],[289,290],[291,298],[298,299],[300,308],[308,309],[310,313],[314,322],[323,325],[326,329],[330,341],[342,346],[347,349],[350,355],[355,356],[357,365],[366,369],[370,377],[378,382],[383,387],[388,392],[393,401],[401,402],[403,411],[412,416],[417,420],[421,428],[429,438],[439,444],[445,448],[449,458],[459,462],[463,464],[465,475],[476,483],[484,494],[494,495],[496,499],[500,509],[510,516],[517,524],[525,536],[537,544],[545,548],[549,557],[558,563],[564,571],[572,574],[575,579],[580,590],[591,594],[595,598],[599,606],[607,609],[610,613],[614,622],[623,626],[627,634],[635,639],[640,643],[644,656],[656,657],[658,665],[666,670],[671,675],[676,680],[681,686],[687,688],[689,695],[696,701],[702,704],[705,710],[711,722],[723,724],[724,727],[728,735],[736,739],[740,741],[742,748],[748,749],[750,752],[753,757],[758,761],[762,766],[767,774],[775,782],[783,785],[786,789],[790,798],[799,807],[807,808],[809,812],[813,817],[818,821],[822,825],[826,829],[830,833],[834,840],[841,844],[845,848],[849,855],[856,864],[865,868],[869,873],[874,877],[878,882],[883,887],[888,892],[893,896],[897,900],[901,910],[911,922],[922,923],[924,928],[929,932],[933,937],[938,940],[941,943],[944,951],[952,955],[956,962],[963,965],[966,973],[974,978],[978,979],[980,988],[988,989],[990,997],[998,1002],[1003,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1017],[1018,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1038],[1039,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1078],[1079,1086],[1087,1095],[1096,1097],[1097,1099],[1100,1106],[1106,1107],[1107,1108],[1109,1112],[1113,1117],[1118,1125],[1126,1134],[1135,1138],[1139,1143],[1144,1146],[1147,1150],[1151,1155],[1155,1156],[1157,1159],[1160,1164],[1165,1166],[1167,1176],[1177,1180],[1181,1187],[1188,1190],[1191,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1206],[1206,1207],[1208,1218],[1219,1222],[1223,1233],[1234,1236],[1237,1239],[1240,1243],[1244,1250],[1251,1258],[1259,1262],[1263,1269],[1270,1279],[1280,1286],[1287,1289],[1290,1292],[1293,1296],[1297,1306],[1307,1316],[1317,1320],[1321,1325],[1326,1330],[1331,1334],[1335,1337],[1338,1348],[1348,1349]],"answers":["the Muslim","Muslim","the Muslim"],"uuid":"5726c0c5dd62a815002e8f78"},"1674":{"context":"There were two kinds of X.25 networks.

But if government is \u201cthe voice of the people,\u201d as it is often called, shouldn\u2019t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is \u201cliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\u201d Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?

The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.

The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings.

Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.\" Garros Creyk went into depth about Vandross's position on Christians.","question":"What did Roland Bainton say about Luther's position on Jews?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,15],[16,24],[24,25],[26,32],[33,38],[39,45],[45,47],[48,57],[58,60],[61,68],[69,71],[72,74],[75,88],[89,91],[92,96],[97,100],[101,105],[106,108],[109,110],[111,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,134],[135,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,160],[160,161],[162,166],[167,175],[176,179],[180,186],[186,188],[189,198],[199,201],[202,209],[209,210],[211,214],[215,218],[219,224],[224,225],[226,229],[230,232],[233,236],[237,241],[242,244],[245,258],[258,259],[260,270],[271,277],[278,284],[285,291],[292,295],[296,300],[301,302],[302,307],[308,310],[311,312],[313,318],[319,321],[322,332],[333,340],[341,344],[345,351],[352,354],[355,364],[365,368],[369,370],[371,377],[378,386],[386,387],[388,400],[400,401],[402,405],[406,415],[416,425],[426,429],[430,433],[434,438],[439,445],[446,450],[451,457],[458,467],[468,474],[475,478],[479,481],[482,485],[486,487],[487,493],[494,501],[501,502],[503,505],[506,510],[510,511],[511,519],[520,523],[524,528],[529,537],[538,546],[547,550],[551,554],[555,561],[562,568],[569,571],[572,575],[576,580],[580,581],[582,590],[591,593],[594,598],[599,602],[603,612],[613,615],[616,619],[620,628],[628,629],[629,630],[631,639],[640,648],[649,655],[656,660],[661,667],[667,669],[670,678],[679,686],[687,690],[691,695],[696,700],[701,708],[709,716],[717,719],[720,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[738,747],[747,748],[749,752],[753,757],[758,763],[764,767],[768,770],[771,781],[782,789],[790,796],[796,798],[799,806],[807,810],[811,815],[816,824],[824,825],[826,829],[830,836],[836,837],[837,842],[843,849],[849,850],[851,858],[859,863],[864,866],[867,870],[871,878],[879,882],[883,888],[889,893],[894,901],[902,906],[906,907],[907,914],[915,919],[920,924],[925,932],[933,939],[939,941],[942,946],[946,947],[948,952],[953,955],[956,967],[968,974],[975,979],[980,982],[983,988],[989,991],[992,998],[999,1002],[1003,1005],[1006,1011],[1012,1014],[1015,1026],[1027,1038],[1039,1050],[1051,1053],[1054,1058],[1059,1071],[1072,1076],[1077,1084],[1085,1090],[1091,1103],[1104,1111],[1112,1114],[1115,1121],[1122,1129],[1129,1130],[1131,1140],[1140,1141],[1142,1148],[1149,1156],[1156,1157],[1158,1163],[1164,1170],[1171,1180],[1181,1184],[1185,1191],[1192,1202],[1202,1203],[1204,1209],[1210,1211],[1211,1214],[1215,1220],[1221,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1241],[1242,1246],[1247,1253],[1254,1258],[1259,1260],[1260,1262],[1263,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1275],[1276,1281],[1282,1286],[1286,1287],[1288,1291],[1292,1299],[1299,1300],[1301,1304],[1305,1313],[1314,1317],[1318,1326],[1327,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1343],[1344,1346],[1347,1354],[1355,1361],[1361,1362],[1362,1363],[1364,1370],[1371,1376],[1377,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1392],[1393,1398],[1399,1407],[1407,1409],[1410,1418],[1419,1421],[1422,1432],[1432,1433]],"answers":["religious and in no respect racial","entirely religious","entirely religious and in no respect racial"],"uuid":"56f8b9839e9bad19000a03c3-high-conf-turk2"},"1385":{"context":"To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

Outler's work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.","question":"Who were two of the founders of the United Methodist Church?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,17],[18,27],[28,41],[42,49],[50,52],[53,56],[57,68],[69,78],[78,79],[80,86],[87,94],[95,98],[99,107],[108,118],[119,129],[129,130],[131,139],[140,146],[147,156],[157,166],[167,170],[171,185],[186,188],[189,196],[197,201],[202,209],[210,214],[215,219],[219,220],[221,226],[227,236],[237,240],[241,248],[249,252],[253,255],[256,262],[263,265],[266,269],[270,278],[279,281],[282,285],[286,292],[292,294],[295,303],[303,304],[305,315],[316,320],[321,327],[328,331],[332,339],[340,346],[347,348],[348,357],[357,358],[358,359],[360,363],[364,368],[369,375],[376,383],[384,393],[394,397],[398,404],[405,410],[411,412],[412,418],[419,427],[427,428],[428,429],[430,433],[434,439],[440,448],[449,450],[450,461],[462,473],[473,474],[474,475],[476,480],[481,484],[485,494],[495,497],[498,501],[502,508],[509,518],[519,525],[526,528],[529,533],[533,534],[535,545],[546,552],[553,555],[556,562],[563,566],[567,570],[571,575],[576,581],[582,594],[595,609],[610,618],[618,619],[620,626],[626,628],[629,633],[634,640],[641,648],[649,651],[652,655],[656,660],[661,663],[664,669],[669,670],[671,674],[675,677],[678,680],[681,688],[689,699],[700,703],[704,709],[710,716],[717,726],[727,737],[737,738]],"answers":["John Wesley and Charles Wesley","John Wesley and Charles Wesley","John Wesley and Charles Wesley"],"uuid":"5730ab288ab72b1400f9c654"},"1984":{"context":"On July 31, 1995, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement to merge with Capital Cities\/ABC for $19 billion. Disney shareholders approved the merger at a special conference in New York City on January 4, 1996, with the acquisition of Capital Cities\/ABC being completed on February 9; following the sale, Disney renamed its new subsidiary ABC Inc. In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition integrated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% interest in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment; and Capital Cities\/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company. As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million. On April 4, Disney sold the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO. Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block. In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom Sports Night, centering on the travails of the staff of a SportsCenter-style sports news program; despite earning critical praise and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.","question":"Who took Thomas Murphy's place after the Disney acquisition of ABC?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[8,10],[10,11],[12,16],[16,17],[18,21],[22,26],[27,33],[34,41],[42,51],[52,54],[55,64],[65,67],[68,73],[74,78],[79,86],[87,93],[93,94],[94,97],[98,101],[102,103],[103,105],[106,113],[113,114],[115,121],[122,134],[135,143],[144,147],[148,154],[155,157],[158,159],[160,167],[168,178],[179,181],[182,185],[186,190],[191,195],[196,198],[199,206],[207,208],[208,209],[210,214],[214,215],[216,220],[221,224],[225,236],[237,239],[240,247],[248,254],[254,255],[255,258],[259,264],[265,274],[275,277],[278,286],[287,288],[288,289],[290,299],[300,303],[304,308],[308,309],[310,316],[317,324],[325,328],[329,332],[333,343],[344,347],[348,352],[353,355],[356,364],[365,367],[368,371],[372,375],[376,383],[383,384],[385,388],[389,395],[396,407],[408,418],[419,422],[422,424],[425,428],[429,434],[434,435],[435,438],[438,439],[439,447],[448,458],[459,462],[463,465],[466,471],[472,480],[480,481],[482,485],[486,488],[488,489],[490,498],[499,501],[502,506],[506,507],[508,517],[518,527],[528,530],[531,534],[535,542],[543,550],[550,551],[552,555],[556,566],[567,575],[575,576],[577,580],[581,589],[590,603],[603,604],[605,608],[609,616],[617,623],[623,624],[624,627],[627,629],[630,638],[639,642],[643,652],[653,663],[664,668],[669,672],[673,680],[680,681],[682,684],[685,688],[689,698],[699,704],[705,712],[713,716],[717,724],[725,729],[730,737],[738,742],[743,745],[746,749],[750,754],[754,755],[755,757],[757,758],[759,765],[766,770],[771,774],[775,782],[783,794],[795,802],[803,807],[807,808],[808,810],[811,813],[814,819],[820,832],[833,836],[837,838],[838,841],[842,849],[849,850],[851,853],[854,859],[860,861],[861,862],[863,869],[870,874],[875,878],[879,883],[884,894],[895,899],[900,903],[904,907],[908,918],[919,924],[925,932],[933,939],[940,942],[943,949],[950,956],[957,960],[961,962],[962,966],[967,974],[974,975],[976,985],[986,989],[990,996],[996,997],[998,1004],[1005,1007],[1008,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1023],[1024,1028],[1029,1035],[1036,1040],[1041,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1060],[1061,1070],[1071,1074],[1075,1078],[1078,1079],[1080,1086],[1087,1090],[1091,1095],[1096,1098],[1099,1102],[1103,1109],[1109,1110],[1111,1117],[1117,1119],[1120,1130],[1131,1141],[1142,1147],[1148,1151],[1152,1159],[1160,1168],[1169,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1196],[1197,1199],[1200,1204],[1205,1216],[1217,1220],[1221,1224],[1225,1230],[1231,1236],[1236,1237],[1238,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1252],[1253,1257],[1258,1265],[1266,1269],[1270,1276],[1277,1279],[1280,1286],[1286,1288],[1289,1297],[1297,1299],[1300,1311],[1312,1319],[1320,1323],[1324,1327],[1328,1336],[1337,1344],[1345,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1354],[1355,1359],[1359,1360],[1361,1364],[1365,1374],[1375,1378],[1379,1384],[1385,1391],[1391,1392],[1392,1399],[1400,1406],[1407,1413],[1414,1419],[1419,1420],[1421,1430],[1431,1433],[1434,1437],[1438,1446],[1447,1449],[1450,1453],[1454,1459],[1460,1462],[1463,1464],[1465,1477],[1477,1478],[1478,1483],[1484,1490],[1491,1495],[1496,1503],[1503,1504],[1505,1512],[1513,1520],[1521,1529],[1530,1536],[1537,1540],[1541,1549],[1550,1554],[1555,1561],[1561,1562],[1563,1566],[1567,1573],[1574,1577],[1578,1587],[1588,1590],[1591,1595],[1596,1601],[1602,1605],[1606,1613],[1613,1614]],"answers":["Robert Iger","Robert Iger","Robert Iger"],"uuid":"57273d19708984140094db40"},"364":{"context":"The FSO Car Factory was established in 1951.

This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction.

The United Presbyterian Catholic uses crackers in the sacrament of the Sacred Eucharist.","question":"What does the United Methodist Church use in the sacrament of the Holy Communion?","spans":[[0,12],[12,13],[14,17],[18,27],[28,34],[35,38],[39,48],[49,52],[53,63],[64,72],[72,73],[74,78],[79,85],[86,92],[93,100],[101,104],[105,112],[113,115],[116,124],[125,127],[128,131],[132,138],[139,145],[145,146],[147,148],[148,151],[152,155],[156,158],[159,164],[164,165],[165,166],[167,170],[171,173],[174,177],[178,184],[185,187],[188,190],[191,200],[200,201],[202,204],[205,208],[209,213],[213,214],[215,224],[225,234],[235,238],[239,241],[242,246],[247,248],[249,255],[256,259],[260,262],[263,268],[269,272],[273,283],[284,289],[290,303],[304,306],[307,309],[310,313],[314,318],[318,319],[320,325],[326,329],[330,336],[337,346],[347,353],[354,360],[361,365],[366,368],[369,370],[370,377],[378,381],[382,386],[386,387],[387,395],[396,403],[404,406],[407,417],[418,422],[423,430],[431,433],[434,435],[436,444],[445,452],[453,455],[456,459],[459,461],[462,472],[473,476],[477,486],[487,491],[492,495],[496,503],[503,504],[504,505],[506,508],[509,513],[513,514],[515,518],[519,525],[526,535],[536,542],[543,547],[548,559],[560,565],[566,571],[572,574],[575,578],[579,588],[589,591],[592,596],[597,606],[606,607],[608,612],[613,614],[614,624],[625,633],[634,641],[642,645],[646,656],[657,667],[667,668],[669,677],[678,681],[682,695],[696,698],[699,707],[708,711],[712,717],[717,718],[719,722],[723,733],[734,737],[738,744],[744,746],[747,754],[755,757],[758,768],[768,769],[769,770],[771,779],[779,780],[781,783],[784,788],[789,792],[793,797],[797,798],[799,802],[803,809],[810,819],[820,826],[826,828],[829,836],[837,842],[843,845],[846,852],[853,856],[857,864],[865,871],[872,874],[875,878],[879,885],[886,896],[897,899],[900,907],[908,912],[913,920],[921,924],[925,929],[929,930],[931,934],[935,941],[942,954],[955,963],[964,968],[969,977],[978,980],[981,984],[985,994],[995,997],[998,1001],[1002,1008],[1009,1018],[1018,1019]],"answers":["unfermented grape juice","uses unfermented grape juice","unfermented grape juice"],"uuid":"5730b2ac2461fd1900a9cfb5-high-conf-turk1"},"933":{"context":"Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007\u201308 season.

This is a big problem, since O2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses rubisco.","question":"What is wasted by rubisco's flaw?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,13],[14,21],[22,26],[27,32],[33,42],[43,45],[46,49],[50,57],[58,60],[61,75],[75,76],[77,89],[90,93],[94,96],[97,103],[104,110],[111,118],[118,119],[120,127],[128,131],[132,133],[134,141],[141,142],[142,144],[145,148],[149,156],[157,171],[172,179],[180,186],[187,194],[195,198],[199,205],[205,206],[207,209],[210,212],[213,217],[218,224],[225,239],[239,240],[241,248],[249,255],[256,268],[269,275],[276,282],[283,285],[286,291],[292,302],[302,303],[304,308],[309,312],[313,316],[317,320],[321,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,341],[342,347],[348,354],[355,358],[359,362],[363,368],[369,377],[377,378],[379,382],[383,387],[388,390],[391,396],[397,402],[403,411],[411,412],[413,417],[418,420],[421,422],[423,426],[427,434],[434,435],[436,441],[442,444],[445,447],[448,456],[457,459],[460,463],[464,471],[472,477],[478,487],[488,490],[491,505],[505,506],[507,514],[515,521],[522,526],[527,530],[531,535],[536,538],[539,542],[543,549],[550,555],[556,561],[562,566],[567,574],[574,575]],"answers":["ATP energy","ATP energy","ATP energy"],"uuid":"572971af6aef051400154ee2"},"1634":{"context":"The \"West Side\" of Fresno, also often called \"Southwest Fresno\", is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.

This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas.

Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.","question":"What spacecraft did the Soviets use to send animals to space and around the moon's orbit?","spans":[[0,6],[7,8],[9,12],[13,20],[21,23],[24,26],[27,30],[31,32],[33,40],[41,43],[44,52],[53,57],[57,58],[59,65],[66,68],[69,77],[77,78],[79,84],[85,88],[89,100],[100,101],[102,110],[111,113],[114,115],[116,122],[123,124],[125,132],[133,135],[136,139],[140,146],[147,150],[150,151],[152,154],[155,158],[159,165],[166,168],[169,172],[173,179],[180,185],[186,190],[191,194],[195,197],[198,203],[204,207],[208,210],[211,216],[217,219],[220,224],[224,225],[226,232],[233,237],[238,243],[244,247],[248,254],[255,256],[257,259],[260,267],[268,274],[275,280],[280,281],[281,289],[290,297],[297,298],[299,303],[304,311],[312,318],[319,322],[323,332],[333,336],[337,341],[342,346],[347,349],[350,357],[358,364],[365,366],[367,369],[370,375],[376,379],[380,384],[385,392],[392,393],[394,403],[404,407],[408,409],[410,417],[418,420],[421,424],[425,429],[430,437],[438,440],[441,446],[447,451],[451,452],[453,456],[457,468],[469,472],[473,474],[475,482],[482,483],[484,488],[489,494],[495,499],[500,503],[504,511],[512,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,525],[526,532],[533,538],[539,542],[543,547],[548,555],[556,562],[563,566],[567,571],[572,574],[575,584],[585,587],[587,588],[589,593],[593,594],[595,601],[602,606],[607,608],[608,609],[610,613],[614,616],[617,620],[621,629],[630,634],[635,640],[641,645],[646,652],[653,656],[657,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,683],[683,684],[685,688],[689,697],[698,701],[702,705],[706,715],[716,724],[725,730],[731,741],[742,752],[753,755],[756,762],[763,764],[764,765],[766,772],[773,781],[782,787],[788,794],[795,798],[799,804],[805,811],[811,812],[813,816],[817,823],[824,831],[832,838],[839,847],[848,851],[852,857],[857,859],[860,869],[870,872],[873,879],[880,882],[883,888],[889,895],[896,898],[899,901],[902,907],[907,908],[909,921],[922,932],[933,941],[942,944],[945,948],[949,954],[955,962],[963,965],[966,975],[976,979],[979,980],[981,984],[985,994],[995,1001],[1002,1004],[1005,1010],[1010,1011]],"answers":["Zond 5","Zond 5","Zond 5","Zond 5","Zond 5"],"uuid":"5725e28f38643c19005ace24"},"1082":{"context":"Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members.

The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement. Strong winds caused the spread of the Tampa fire in 1891.","question":"What caused the spread of the Jacksonville fire in 1901?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,8],[8,9],[10,14],[14,15],[16,24],[25,37],[38,41],[42,49],[50,52],[53,54],[55,59],[60,64],[65,72],[73,75],[76,77],[78,85],[86,90],[90,91],[92,99],[100,104],[105,107],[108,109],[110,116],[117,125],[126,133],[134,137],[138,145],[146,154],[155,157],[158,164],[165,168],[169,177],[178,181],[182,186],[187,189],[190,196],[197,204],[204,205],[206,208],[209,213],[214,219],[220,225],[225,226],[227,229],[230,235],[236,243],[244,247],[248,252],[253,259],[259,260],[261,270],[271,275],[276,281],[282,291],[291,292],[293,297],[298,303],[304,310],[311,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,332],[333,342],[342,343],[344,347],[348,359],[360,368],[369,371],[372,379],[380,384],[385,388],[389,392],[393,395],[396,399],[400,404],[405,414],[415,417],[418,425],[426,429],[430,434],[434,435],[436,444],[445,453],[454,461],[462,469],[470,473],[474,477],[478,482],[483,486],[487,492],[493,500],[501,503],[504,512],[513,518],[518,519],[520,522],[523,526],[527,529],[530,539],[540,549],[550,557],[558,560],[561,573],[573,574],[575,577],[578,580],[581,585],[586,589],[590,594],[595,599],[600,603],[604,610],[611,616],[617,619],[620,624],[625,627],[628,636],[636,637],[638,645],[645,646],[647,650],[651,654],[655,660],[661,667],[668,672],[673,675],[676,683],[683,684],[685,690],[691,699],[699,700],[701,706],[707,709],[710,713],[714,715],[715,720],[721,725],[726,728],[729,733],[733,734],[734,735],[736,738],[739,742],[743,746],[747,749],[750,753],[754,759],[760,769],[770,772],[773,780],[781,788],[789,792],[793,796],[797,804],[805,810],[811,815],[816,818],[819,822],[823,835],[836,842],[843,849],[849,850],[851,860],[861,866],[867,871],[872,878],[879,882],[883,884],[885,892],[893,899],[900,902],[903,906],[907,921],[922,924],[925,928],[929,933],[933,934],[935,938],[939,944],[945,950],[950,951],[951,956],[957,966],[967,972],[973,975],[976,982],[983,986],[987,990],[991,995],[995,996],[996,1004],[1005,1013],[1014,1016],[1017,1021],[1021,1022],[1023,1026],[1027,1030],[1031,1036],[1037,1045],[1045,1046],[1047,1052],[1053,1055],[1056,1059],[1060,1068],[1069,1073],[1074,1076],[1077,1080],[1081,1084],[1085,1090],[1091,1096],[1097,1101],[1102,1108],[1109,1113],[1113,1114],[1115,1118],[1119,1124],[1125,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1135],[1136,1142],[1142,1144],[1145,1153],[1154,1165],[1165,1166],[1167,1173],[1174,1179],[1180,1186],[1187,1190],[1191,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1210],[1211,1215],[1216,1218],[1219,1223],[1223,1224]],"answers":["Spanish moss","kitchen fire","Spanish moss"],"uuid":"5728170d3acd2414000df443-high-conf-turk4"},"1538":{"context":"Between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle.

Vandross was an outlaw and his works were banned.","question":"Besides declaring Luther to be an outlaw and banning his works, what else was decided?","spans":[[0,4],[5,8],[9,13],[14,18],[19,23],[23,24],[25,32],[33,44],[45,49],[50,54],[55,57],[58,67],[68,74],[74,76],[77,81],[81,82],[83,86],[87,94],[95,104],[105,108],[109,114],[115,120],[121,123],[124,127],[128,133],[134,136],[137,142],[143,145],[146,148],[149,152],[153,157],[157,158],[159,168],[169,175],[176,178],[179,185],[185,186],[187,194],[195,198],[199,209],[209,210],[211,214],[215,224],[225,228],[229,235],[235,236],[237,238],[238,240],[241,245],[246,249],[250,252],[253,255],[256,267],[268,271],[272,280],[281,283],[284,285],[286,295],[296,303],[303,304],[304,305],[306,308],[309,313],[314,318],[319,321],[322,323],[324,329],[330,333],[334,340],[341,343],[344,351],[352,354],[355,359],[360,366],[367,371],[372,374],[375,382],[382,383],[384,386],[387,396],[397,403],[404,406],[407,411],[412,418],[419,426],[427,432],[433,444],[444,445],[446,454],[455,458],[459,461],[462,468],[469,472],[473,476],[477,482],[483,487],[488,494],[494,495]],"answers":["his arrest","requiring his arrest","arrest"],"uuid":"56f827caa6d7ea1400e1743c-high-conf-turk1"},"295":{"context":"Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell.

However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan.

He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759). Rigaud reacted when Miller was seen as the larger threat.","question":"How did Vaudreuil react when Johnson was seen as larger threat?","spans":[[0,7],[7,9],[10,20],[21,24],[25,31],[32,41],[42,46],[47,54],[54,56],[56,57],[58,63],[64,67],[68,75],[76,78],[79,82],[83,89],[89,91],[92,100],[100,101],[102,105],[106,113],[114,116],[117,126],[126,127],[128,130],[131,134],[135,144],[145,149],[150,159],[160,165],[166,169],[170,178],[179,185],[186,190],[191,193],[194,197],[198,203],[204,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,216],[217,220],[221,224],[225,229],[230,235],[236,243],[244,246],[247,251],[252,255],[256,264],[265,267],[268,277],[278,285],[286,293],[293,295],[296,304],[305,311],[311,312],[313,317],[318,325],[326,329],[330,334],[335,337],[338,341],[342,348],[349,355],[355,356],[357,366],[367,371],[372,379],[380,382],[383,387],[388,391],[392,400],[401,403],[404,408],[409,413],[414,420],[420,421],[422,429],[430,437],[438,440],[441,447],[448,451],[452,459],[460,470],[471,473],[474,478],[479,485],[486,488],[489,492],[493,498],[499,502],[503,505],[506,516],[517,519],[520,523],[524,530],[531,536],[536,537],[538,541],[542,549],[550,553],[554,562],[563,572],[573,575],[575,576],[577,580],[581,588],[588,590],[591,597],[598,605],[606,609],[610,619],[620,622],[623,629],[629,630],[631,634],[635,638],[639,645],[646,653],[654,657],[658,660],[661,664],[665,671],[672,678],[679,681],[682,686],[687,693],[694,701],[702,706],[707,713],[714,717],[718,722],[723,730],[731,736],[736,737],[738,741],[742,748],[749,754],[755,769],[769,770],[771,775],[776,780],[781,786],[787,798],[799,803],[804,807],[808,813],[813,814],[815,822],[822,824],[825,832],[833,840],[841,843],[844,848],[849,856],[857,862],[862,863],[864,867],[868,871],[872,878],[879,887],[888,890],[891,902],[903,908],[908,909],[910,915],[916,920],[921,926],[927,930],[931,943],[944,946],[947,951],[952,960],[961,962],[962,967],[968,975],[976,980],[981,992],[993,998],[999,1006],[1007,1014],[1015,1017],[1018,1022],[1022,1023],[1023,1024],[1025,1031],[1032,1039],[1040,1044],[1045,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1060],[1061,1063],[1064,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1081],[1081,1082]],"answers":["sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat","sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric"],"uuid":"5733f8dc4776f419006615f8-high-conf-turk2"},"2989":{"context":"In addition to climate assessment reports, the IPCC is publishing Special Reports on specific topics.

Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men.

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in \"Father's Day\", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in \"The Big Bang\". In \"The Almost People\" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In \"The Name of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. The Doctor of the Central Park was last referred to as \"  his secret\" .","question":"What Doctor was first referred to as \"his secret\"?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,15],[16,25],[26,28],[29,35],[36,45],[46,48],[49,54],[55,60],[61,63],[64,71],[72,75],[76,80],[81,83],[84,89],[90,98],[99,105],[105,106],[107,109],[110,114],[114,116],[117,120],[121,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,143],[144,152],[153,156],[157,164],[165,174],[175,183],[184,193],[194,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,215],[215,217],[218,221],[222,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,245],[246,249],[250,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,279],[280,285],[286,293],[293,294],[295,298],[299,302],[303,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,331],[332,338],[339,346],[347,351],[352,355],[356,367],[368,373],[374,381],[381,382],[383,386],[387,391],[392,399],[399,400],[401,408],[409,417],[418,426],[427,434],[435,443],[443,444],[445,452],[453,462],[463,468],[469,477],[478,480],[481,485],[485,487],[488,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,508],[509,514],[515,520],[520,521],[522,524],[525,529],[529,530],[531,536],[537,544],[545,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,569],[570,572],[573,577],[578,583],[584,585],[585,589],[590,595],[595,596],[597,606],[607,612],[613,620],[620,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,639],[640,642],[643,647],[647,649],[650,654],[655,666],[667,674],[675,682],[682,683],[684,685],[685,688],[689,692],[693,695],[696,699],[700,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,722],[722,724],[725,730],[731,737],[738,746],[747,756],[757,761],[762,767],[768,770],[771,774],[775,783],[784,790],[791,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,815],[816,822],[822,823],[824,826],[827,831],[832,834],[835,840],[841,848],[849,853],[854,857],[858,860],[861,864],[865,873],[874,880],[880,881],[882,884],[885,893],[893,894],[895,898],[899,905],[906,909],[910,922],[923,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,961],[962,965],[966,977],[977,978],[979,983],[984,987],[988,992],[993,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1007],[1007,1008],[1009,1012],[1013,1018],[1019,1025],[1026,1036],[1037,1044],[1045,1047],[1048,1051],[1052,1057],[1058,1061],[1062,1067],[1068,1074],[1075,1076],[1076,1082],[1083,1089],[1090,1093],[1094,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1107],[1107,1108],[1108,1109],[1110,1113],[1114,1119],[1120,1126],[1127,1137],[1138,1141],[1142,1151],[1152,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1167],[1168,1171],[1172,1177],[1178,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1188],[1189,1195],[1195,1196],[1197,1200],[1201,1207],[1208,1214],[1215,1225],[1226,1229],[1230,1239],[1240,1244],[1245,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1267],[1268,1270],[1271,1278],[1279,1280],[1280,1283],[1284,1285],[1285,1292],[1292,1293],[1293,1294],[1295,1297],[1298,1301],[1302,1307],[1308,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1335],[1336,1344],[1345,1346],[1347,1353],[1354,1361],[1362,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1389,1391],[1392,1393],[1393,1399],[1399,1401],[1402,1405],[1405,1406],[1406,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1415],[1416,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1439],[1440,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1453],[1454,1458],[1459,1463],[1464,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1476],[1476,1479],[1480,1483],[1484,1488],[1488,1489],[1489,1490],[1491,1493],[1494,1495],[1495,1498],[1499,1505],[1506,1512],[1512,1513],[1514,1517],[1518,1524],[1525,1530],[1531,1535],[1535,1536],[1536,1538],[1538,1539],[1539,1543],[1544,1548],[1549,1556],[1557,1565],[1566,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1586],[1587,1591],[1592,1603],[1604,1606],[1607,1609],[1610,1614],[1615,1619],[1620,1621],[1622,1627],[1628,1635],[1635,1636],[1637,1639],[1640,1641],[1641,1644],[1645,1649],[1650,1652],[1653,1656],[1657,1663],[1663,1664],[1664,1665],[1666,1669],[1670,1678],[1679,1685],[1686,1691],[1692,1694],[1695,1702],[1703,1714],[1715,1717],[1718,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1731],[1732,1734],[1735,1741],[1742,1744],[1745,1747],[1748,1749],[1749,1752],[1753,1759],[1759,1760],[1761,1764],[1765,1768],[1769,1771],[1772,1784],[1785,1793],[1794,1796],[1797,1799],[1800,1803],[1804,1807],[1808,1814],[1814,1815],[1816,1819],[1820,1826],[1827,1829],[1830,1833],[1834,1841],[1842,1846],[1847,1850],[1851,1855],[1856,1864],[1865,1867],[1868,1870],[1871,1872],[1872,1873],[1874,1877],[1878,1884],[1884,1885],[1886,1887]],"answers":["the War Doctor","an unknown incarnation of himself","the War Doctor"],"uuid":"57280b2b2ca10214002d9c66-high-conf-turk3"},"698":{"context":"In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the teacher is an office in the Aaronic priesthood, generally conferred on young boys or recent converts, and has little in common with the \"spiritual teacher\" archetype. The role of \"spiritual teacher\" may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.","question":"What is an abbreviation for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,13],[14,16],[17,22],[23,29],[30,32],[33,39],[39,40],[40,43],[44,50],[51,52],[52,55],[56,62],[62,63],[63,64],[65,68],[69,76],[77,79],[80,82],[83,89],[90,92],[93,96],[97,104],[105,115],[115,116],[117,126],[127,136],[137,139],[140,145],[146,150],[151,153],[154,160],[161,169],[169,170],[171,174],[175,178],[179,185],[186,188],[189,195],[196,200],[201,204],[205,206],[206,215],[216,223],[223,224],[225,234],[234,235],[236,239],[240,244],[245,247],[248,249],[249,258],[259,266],[266,267],[268,271],[272,274],[275,281],[282,284],[285,289],[290,301],[302,304],[305,308],[309,312],[313,319],[319,320],[321,326],[327,328],[329,336],[337,343],[343,344],[345,348],[349,352],[353,357],[358,361],[362,368],[368,369],[370,374],[375,380],[381,383],[384,390],[390,391],[392,394],[395,397],[398,404],[405,407],[408,411],[411,412],[413,416],[417,425],[426,428],[429,438],[439,449],[450,452],[453,456],[457,460],[461,467],[468,470],[471,478],[479,481],[482,486],[487,489],[490,493],[494,498],[499,500],[500,503],[503,504],[504,510],[510,511],[512,522],[523,525],[526,539],[539,540],[541,545],[546,547],[548,556],[557,565],[566,572],[573,575],[576,579],[580,587],[588,591],[592,598],[599,601],[602,603],[604,610],[611,613],[614,621],[622,631],[632,640],[641,644],[645,648],[649,651],[652,655],[656,662],[662,663],[664,671],[672,674],[675,687],[688,692],[693,696],[697,701],[701,702],[703,707],[708,710],[711,714],[715,722],[723,725],[726,729],[730,731],[732,738],[739,741],[742,745],[746,749],[750,756],[756,757],[758,763],[764,766],[767,781],[782,784],[785,792],[793,801],[802,807],[808,813],[814,822],[823,826],[827,836],[837,846],[847,849],[850,858],[859,861],[862,870],[870,871],[872,876],[877,887],[888,903],[904,907],[908,916],[917,919],[920,925],[926,928],[929,932],[933,939],[940,942],[943,946],[947,952],[953,957],[958,960],[961,964],[965,969],[969,970],[971,978],[978,979],[980,990],[991,1000],[1001,1009],[1010,1012],[1013,1020],[1021,1023],[1024,1029],[1030,1037],[1038,1041],[1042,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1061],[1061,1062],[1063,1068],[1069,1071],[1072,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1090],[1090,1091],[1091,1094],[1095,1101],[1102,1104],[1105,1110],[1111,1118],[1119,1124],[1125,1127],[1128,1131],[1132,1138],[1138,1139],[1140,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1151],[1152,1159],[1160,1162],[1163,1171],[1171,1172],[1173,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1187],[1187,1188],[1189,1193],[1194,1202],[1203,1205],[1206,1215],[1216,1223],[1224,1230],[1231,1232],[1233,1241],[1242,1248],[1249,1252],[1253,1264],[1265,1273],[1273,1274]],"answers":["LDS Church","LDS Church","LDS Church"],"uuid":"56e77c6737bdd419002c401d"},"2867":{"context":"The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya.

It is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine (no compound) with superheated steam and consumes approx. 4 kg (8.8 lb) of steam per kWh.[not in citation given]","question":"What modern company has been notably working on a steam engine using modern materials?","spans":[[0,8],[9,12],[13,26],[27,32],[33,39],[40,42],[43,45],[46,52],[53,55],[56,66],[67,77],[78,81],[81,82],[83,90],[91,100],[101,104],[105,114],[115,117],[118,128],[129,132],[133,142],[143,145],[146,149],[150,156],[157,159],[160,162],[163,174],[175,177],[178,186],[187,197],[198,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,218],[219,232],[233,235],[236,238],[239,245],[246,249],[250,254],[255,263],[264,266],[267,272],[273,279],[280,289],[290,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,314],[315,317],[318,323],[323,324],[325,328],[329,339],[340,342],[343,356],[356,358],[359,364],[365,371],[372,379],[380,384],[385,387],[387,388],[388,390],[390,391],[392,394],[395,399],[399,400],[400,408],[409,416],[416,417],[418,420],[421,423],[424,425],[426,432],[432,433],[433,437],[437,438],[439,449],[450,456],[457,458],[458,460],[461,469],[469,470],[471,475],[476,487],[488,493],[494,497],[498,506],[507,513],[513,514],[515,516],[517,519],[520,521],[521,524],[525,527],[527,528],[529,531],[532,537],[538,541],[542,550],[551,553],[554,562],[563,568],[568,569]],"answers":["Energiprojekt AB","Energiprojekt AB","Energiprojekt AB"],"uuid":"57115bf350c2381900b54a93"},"3322":{"context":"The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.","question":"colonial rule, or physical occupation of a territory is an example of what kind of imperialism?","spans":[[0,3],[4,14],[15,17],[18,29],[30,33],[34,37],[38,42],[43,52],[53,56],[57,66],[67,70],[71,74],[75,85],[86,90],[91,93],[94,103],[104,107],[108,116],[117,119],[120,125],[126,132],[132,133],[134,136],[137,143],[143,144],[145,152],[152,153],[153,160],[161,175],[175,176],[177,184],[185,187],[187,188],[189,193],[194,205],[205,206],[206,207],[208,212],[213,216],[217,221],[222,233],[233,234],[235,237],[238,246],[247,251],[252,266],[267,274],[274,275],[276,278],[279,283],[284,287],[288,293],[294,296],[297,307],[308,310],[311,318],[319,321],[322,323],[324,329],[330,332],[333,339],[340,344],[345,352],[352,353],[354,356],[357,362],[363,366],[367,371],[372,381],[382,387],[388,391],[392,402],[403,405],[406,417],[418,421],[422,427],[428,433],[434,436],[437,438],[438,444],[444,445],[446,449],[450,451],[451,459],[459,460],[461,472],[472,473],[474,477],[478,483],[484,491],[492,500],[501,508],[509,511],[512,513],[513,517],[517,518],[518,525],[526,534],[535,539],[539,540],[541,546],[547,550],[551,557],[558,565],[566,570],[571,577],[578,582],[583,589],[590,595],[596,606],[607,618],[619,624],[625,627],[628,637],[637,638],[639,647],[648,652],[653,655],[656,665],[666,670],[671,677],[678,682],[683,689],[690,694],[695,706],[707,715],[715,716],[717,721],[722,724],[725,732],[732,733],[734,738],[739,747],[748,752],[752,753],[754,757],[758,765],[766,768],[769,775],[776,780],[781,787],[788,795],[796,809],[810,821],[821,822],[823,832],[833,837],[838,847],[848,852],[853,858],[859,864],[865,869],[870,873],[873,876],[877,879],[880,886],[886,887],[888,897],[898,900],[901,908],[909,919],[920,924],[925,934],[935,938],[939,949],[950,954],[954,955],[956,958],[959,965],[966,975],[976,981],[982,984],[985,991],[992,997],[998,1008],[1009,1019],[1019,1020]],"answers":["\"formal\"","formal","formal","formal","formal"],"uuid":"57306797396df919000960ef"},"16":{"context":"Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.","question":"In the 10th week of the 2015 season, what injury was Peyton Manning dealing with?","spans":[[0,9],[10,15],[16,20],[21,23],[24,27],[28,38],[39,44],[45,47],[48,51],[52,60],[61,67],[67,69],[70,78],[78,79],[80,83],[84,90],[91,98],[99,108],[109,117],[118,126],[127,134],[134,135],[136,145],[146,147],[148,154],[155,162],[163,167],[168,172],[173,178],[179,183],[184,187],[188,189],[189,192],[193,196],[197,200],[201,205],[206,216],[217,230],[231,233],[234,237],[238,242],[243,248],[249,251],[252,259],[260,264],[265,270],[270,271],[271,272],[273,276],[277,280],[281,287],[288,290],[291,295],[296,302],[303,305],[306,309],[310,313],[314,318],[319,324],[324,325],[326,331],[332,338],[338,339],[340,343],[344,351],[352,359],[360,362],[363,370],[371,372],[373,376],[376,377],[377,385],[386,393],[394,398],[399,403],[404,412],[413,415],[416,421],[422,424],[425,429],[430,441],[442,448],[449,456],[456,458],[459,466],[467,474],[475,481],[481,482],[483,486],[487,496],[497,501],[502,510],[511,518],[519,522],[523,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,548],[549,553],[553,554],[555,557],[558,562],[563,565],[566,573],[574,580],[581,584],[585,590],[591,602],[603,609],[610,615],[616,619],[620,626],[627,631],[632,636],[637,640],[641,653],[654,659],[660,662],[663,667],[667,668],[669,672],[673,675],[676,677],[678,685],[686,695],[696,702],[703,705],[706,709],[710,714],[715,719],[720,722],[723,726],[727,735],[736,741],[742,745],[746,752],[752,753],[754,757],[758,761],[762,768],[769,773],[774,778],[779,786],[787,790],[791,798],[799,802],[802,803],[804,806],[807,809],[810,816],[817,819],[820,822],[823,826],[827,831],[832,835],[835,836],[836,842],[842,843],[844,852],[853,856],[857,861],[862,865],[866,867],[868,871],[872,877],[877,878],[879,886],[887,890],[891,894],[895,898],[899,901],[902,915],[915,916],[917,919],[920,924],[925,927],[927,928],[929,936],[937,945],[946,947],[948,955],[956,960],[961,963],[964,967],[968,975],[976,985],[986,988],[989,992],[993,997],[998,1002],[1002,1003],[1004,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1018],[1018,1020],[1021,1024],[1024,1025],[1025,1029],[1030,1036],[1037,1040],[1041,1047],[1048,1055],[1056,1061],[1062,1064],[1065,1069],[1070,1074],[1074,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1083],[1084,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1106],[1107,1111],[1112,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1134],[1135,1137],[1138,1144],[1145,1156],[1157,1162],[1163,1171],[1171,1172],[1173,1176],[1177,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1189],[1190,1193],[1194,1201],[1202,1205],[1206,1210],[1211,1213],[1214,1217],[1218,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1234],[1235,1242],[1243,1249],[1249,1250],[1251,1259],[1260,1263],[1264,1271],[1271,1272],[1273,1280],[1280,1281],[1282,1289],[1290,1292],[1293,1300],[1300,1302],[1303,1309],[1310,1316],[1317,1320],[1321,1325],[1326,1328],[1329,1336],[1337,1343],[1344,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1357],[1358,1361],[1362,1369],[1370,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1386],[1387,1394],[1395,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1413],[1414,1422],[1422,1423],[1424,1433],[1434,1436],[1437,1444],[1445,1447],[1447,1448],[1448,1456],[1457,1460],[1461,1469],[1470,1481],[1482,1490],[1491,1494],[1495,1498],[1499,1507],[1508,1510],[1511,1518],[1519,1522],[1523,1527],[1528,1530],[1531,1532],[1533,1536],[1537,1542],[1543,1546],[1547,1551],[1552,1559],[1560,1563],[1564,1568],[1569,1571],[1572,1578],[1579,1582],[1583,1589],[1590,1593],[1594,1601],[1602,1605],[1606,1610],[1610,1611],[1612,1617],[1618,1627],[1628,1639],[1640,1644],[1645,1653],[1653,1654],[1655,1658],[1659,1666],[1666,1667],[1668,1675],[1676,1682],[1683,1689],[1690,1693],[1694,1696],[1697,1702],[1703,1708],[1709,1716],[1716,1717],[1718,1725],[1726,1731],[1732,1739],[1740,1743],[1744,1749],[1749,1750],[1751,1754],[1755,1759],[1760,1763],[1764,1772],[1773,1778],[1779,1786],[1786,1787],[1788,1791],[1792,1796],[1797,1800],[1801,1810],[1811,1813],[1814,1817],[1818,1826],[1827,1837],[1837,1838],[1839,1845],[1846,1849],[1850,1859],[1860,1867],[1867,1868],[1869,1873],[1874,1877],[1878,1885],[1886,1894],[1895,1898],[1899,1903],[1904,1911],[1912,1915],[1916,1922],[1923,1927],[1928,1931],[1932,1939],[1939,1940],[1941,1944],[1945,1952],[1953,1961],[1962,1965],[1966,1973],[1974,1980],[1981,1985],[1986,1987],[1988,1992],[1993,1999],[2000,2003],[2004,2010],[2011,2015],[2015,2016],[2016,2021],[2022,2031],[2032,2042],[2043,2046],[2047,2050],[2051,2059],[2059,2060]],"answers":["plantar fasciitis","a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis"],"uuid":"56bf301c3aeaaa14008c9551"},"1345":{"context":"European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states.

Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed] Jeff Dean may be related to an Austrian politician.","question":"The term may be related to what politician from Switzerland?","spans":[[0,1],[2,6],[7,11],[12,22],[23,25],[26,34],[34,35],[36,44],[45,48],[49,56],[57,64],[64,65],[66,73],[74,84],[85,89],[90,94],[95,103],[103,104],[105,108],[109,117],[118,121],[122,126],[127,131],[132,133],[134,142],[143,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,165],[166,176],[177,185],[186,192],[193,194],[194,198],[199,203],[203,204],[205,208],[209,212],[213,224],[225,235],[236,242],[243,245],[246,251],[252,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,277],[277,278],[279,284],[285,286],[287,293],[294,304],[305,308],[309,311],[312,315],[316,320],[321,327],[328,330],[331,334],[335,337],[338,341],[342,347],[348,352],[353,364],[365,366],[366,375],[376,386],[386,387],[387,388],[389,398],[399,401],[402,405],[406,418],[419,421],[422,423],[424,432],[433,440],[441,445],[446,448],[449,455],[456,466],[467,468],[468,480],[481,483],[484,486],[487,488],[488,489],[490,497],[498,500],[501,504],[505,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,521],[522,525],[526,531],[532,543],[543,544],[544,545],[545,546],[547,553],[554,557],[558,562],[563,569],[569,571],[572,579],[580,584],[585,588],[589,592],[593,599],[600,602],[603,606],[607,616],[617,625],[625,626],[627,629],[630,636],[636,637],[638,644],[644,645],[646,652],[653,661],[661,662],[663,666],[667,668],[669,675],[676,678],[679,682],[683,684],[684,695],[696,701],[701,702],[702,703],[704,706],[707,713],[714,721],[722,724],[725,733],[734,746],[747,751],[752,755],[756,760],[761,763],[764,769],[770,777],[778,780],[781,789],[790,797],[798,801],[802,806],[806,807],[807,812],[813,815],[816,822],[823,826],[827,830],[831,836],[837,850],[850,851],[852,855],[856,861],[862,870],[871,874],[875,886],[887,892],[893,900],[901,903],[904,910],[911,913],[914,919],[920,932],[933,934],[934,937],[938,940],[941,945],[946,958],[959,966],[967,969],[970,973],[974,982],[983,989],[989,990],[991,999],[1000,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1014],[1015,1019],[1020,1022],[1023,1027],[1027,1028],[1029,1030],[1031,1037],[1038,1045],[1046,1048],[1049,1054],[1055,1060],[1061,1063],[1064,1070],[1071,1075],[1076,1079],[1080,1091],[1092,1097],[1098,1100],[1101,1106],[1106,1107],[1108,1111],[1112,1116],[1117,1122],[1123,1127],[1128,1131],[1132,1135],[1136,1140],[1141,1147],[1148,1150],[1151,1160],[1161,1170],[1171,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1185],[1185,1186],[1187,1191],[1191,1192],[1193,1199],[1200,1204],[1205,1215],[1216,1218],[1219,1222],[1223,1225],[1226,1237],[1238,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1264,1265],[1266,1267],[1268,1276],[1277,1288],[1289,1292],[1293,1303],[1304,1309],[1310,1314],[1315,1323],[1324,1333],[1334,1336],[1337,1353],[1354,1360],[1360,1361],[1362,1366],[1367,1371],[1372,1375],[1376,1378],[1379,1386],[1387,1389],[1390,1392],[1393,1401],[1402,1412],[1412,1413]],"answers":["Besan\u00e7on Hugues","Besan\u00e7on Hugues","Besan\u00e7on Hugues"],"uuid":"57106185b654c5140001f8dc-high-conf-turk1"},"797":{"context":"The catechism is one of Luther's most personal works. \"Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes,\" he wrote, \"I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because, roused by a Saturnian hunger, I would rather see them all devoured.

In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.","question":"What was the reason the Italian Constitutional court gave that

During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.

It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory. The most commonplace model is utilized in the simplicity theory.","question":"What is the most commonplace model utilized in complexity theory?","spans":[[0,1],[2,8],[9,16],[17,19],[20,21],[22,34],[35,40],[41,43],[44,45],[46,53],[54,63],[64,71],[71,72],[73,75],[76,78],[79,80],[81,92],[93,99],[100,104],[105,116],[117,124],[125,134],[135,137],[138,139],[140,145],[146,148],[149,153],[153,154],[155,161],[162,170],[171,174],[175,178],[179,187],[188,190],[191,192],[193,202],[203,212],[213,223],[223,224],[225,228],[229,235],[236,238],[239,240],[241,248],[249,259],[260,272],[273,274],[275,284],[285,292],[292,293],[293,301],[302,306],[307,309],[310,318],[319,332],[333,335],[336,337],[338,351],[352,356],[357,358],[359,365],[366,369],[370,375],[375,376],[377,379],[380,382],[383,391],[392,396],[397,399],[400,401],[402,409],[410,413],[414,416],[417,423],[424,426],[427,429],[430,439],[439,440],[441,446],[447,453],[454,455],[456,462],[463,470],[471,475],[476,482],[483,486],[487,494],[494,495],[496,502],[502,503],[504,508],[509,511],[512,515],[516,525],[526,528],[529,532],[533,539],[539,540],[540,546],[547,553],[553,554],[555,566],[566,567],[568,570],[571,573],[574,579],[580,584],[585,595],[596,600],[601,604],[605,607],[608,616],[617,619],[620,625],[626,632],[633,635],[636,647],[648,653],[654,656],[657,659],[660,665],[665,666],[667,671],[672,674],[675,676],[677,680],[681,688],[688,689],[690,696],[696,698],[699,703],[704,706],[707,711],[711,712],[713,721],[722,730],[731,733],[734,737],[738,749],[750,758],[759,762],[763,765],[766,774],[775,777],[778,779],[780,786],[787,794],[794,795],[796,801],[802,808],[809,817],[818,821],[822,826],[827,829],[830,837],[838,852],[852,853],[854,857],[858,861],[862,870],[871,873],[874,876],[877,879],[880,888],[889,891],[892,895],[896,901],[902,907],[908,910],[911,922],[922,923],[924,927],[928,934],[935,942],[943,945],[946,949],[950,954],[955,963],[964,968],[969,974],[975,977],[978,988],[989,995],[995,996],[997,1000],[1001,1005],[1006,1017],[1018,1023],[1024,1026],[1027,1035],[1036,1038],[1039,1042],[1043,1053],[1054,1060],[1060,1061]],"answers":["the Turing machine","the Turing machine","Turing machine"],"uuid":"56e1aba0e3433e1400423097-high-conf-turk1"},"570":{"context":"Tesla, like many of his era, became a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.

The last few of the boilerplate ATK launches carried it with them.","question":"What did the last few of the boilerplate CSM launches carry with them?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,14],[15,21],[22,23],[24,28],[29,36],[37,41],[42,50],[51,55],[56,61],[61,62],[63,67],[68,72],[73,77],[78,83],[84,90],[90,91],[92,100],[101,106],[107,112],[113,119],[120,126],[127,131],[132,137],[137,138],[139,142],[143,148],[149,155],[156,160],[161,162],[163,167],[168,169],[169,170],[170,172],[173,176],[177,185],[186,190],[191,196],[196,197],[198,202],[203,206],[207,215],[216,218],[219,223],[224,232],[233,235],[236,247],[248,252],[253,254],[254,264],[265,271],[272,279],[280,286],[286,287],[288,292],[293,298],[299,301],[302,306],[307,310],[311,315],[315,316],[317,320],[321,325],[326,331],[332,334],[335,340],[341,348],[349,358],[359,362],[363,369],[370,377],[378,380],[381,385],[386,394],[395,402],[403,413],[413,414],[415,420],[421,429],[430,433],[434,440],[441,443],[444,447],[448,458],[459,470],[471,473],[474,483],[484,487],[488,497],[498,501],[502,510],[511,513],[514,528],[529,536],[536,537],[538,541],[542,546],[547,550],[551,553],[554,557],[558,569],[570,573],[574,582],[583,590],[591,593],[594,598],[599,603],[603,604]],"answers":["Pegasus satellites","Pegasus satellites,","Pegasus satellites","Pegasus satellites","Pegasus satellites"],"uuid":"5725d0e3271a42140099d237-high-conf-turk0"},"2709":{"context":"The earliest Doctor Who-related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story The Chase released in 1966.

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.

their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time).

Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce \"free votes\", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on moral issues. A nonmember doesn't have to vote in the party line.","question":"What happens if a member doesn't vote the party line?","spans":[[0,3],[4,11],[12,14],[15,19],[20,25],[26,29],[30,32],[33,42],[43,53],[54,59],[60,69],[70,77],[78,86],[87,95],[96,103],[104,109],[110,113],[114,116],[117,121],[121,122],[123,130],[131,138],[139,143],[144,148],[148,149],[150,155],[156,158],[159,164],[164,165],[166,170],[171,174],[175,179],[180,182],[183,191],[192,196],[197,202],[203,210],[211,215],[216,225],[226,228],[229,232],[233,238],[239,243],[243,244],[245,249],[250,252],[253,256],[257,261],[262,264],[265,269],[270,277],[278,282],[283,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,308],[309,312],[313,315],[316,319],[320,328],[329,331],[332,337],[338,344],[345,354],[355,360],[361,363],[364,369],[370,377],[377,378],[379,385],[386,393],[394,397],[398,400],[401,411],[412,414],[415,423],[424,429],[430,440],[441,447],[448,454],[455,464],[464,465],[466,469],[469,470],[471,473],[474,481],[482,487],[487,488],[489,492],[493,495],[496,504],[505,509],[510,515],[516,523],[524,532],[532,533],[534,538],[538,539],[540,542],[543,547],[548,552],[553,564],[564,565],[566,569],[570,582],[583,585],[586,593],[594,596],[597,600],[601,609],[610,620],[621,626],[627,629],[630,632],[633,636],[636,637],[638,641],[642,651],[652,662],[663,665],[666,673],[674,677],[678,681],[682,692],[693,697],[698,703],[704,709],[709,711],[712,720],[721,724],[725,729],[729,730],[731,733],[734,738],[739,752],[752,753],[754,761],[761,762],[763,770],[771,779],[780,781],[781,785],[786,791],[791,792],[792,793],[794,799],[800,806],[807,814],[815,817],[818,822],[823,825],[826,830],[831,837],[837,838],[839,843],[844,846],[847,856],[857,861],[862,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878],[879,880],[881,890],[891,895],[895,898],[899,903],[904,906],[907,911],[912,914],[915,918],[919,924],[925,929],[929,930]],"answers":["deselected as official party candidates during future elections","deselected as official party candidates","deselected as official party candidates during future elections"],"uuid":"572fc5a1947a6a140053cc8d-high-conf-turk0"},"2633":{"context":"The phrase \"Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa\" entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.

Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment.

He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.","question":"What did Aristotle refer to forced motion as?","spans":[[0,9],[10,18],[19,20],[21,34],[35,45],[46,48],[49,52],[53,60],[61,63],[64,65],[66,71],[72,74],[75,77],[78,86],[87,91],[92,94],[95,107],[108,117],[117,118],[119,121],[122,131],[131,133],[134,138],[138,139],[140,143],[144,155],[156,162],[163,172],[173,177],[178,186],[187,191],[192,196],[197,199],[200,204],[205,207],[208,217],[218,219],[219,226],[227,233],[233,234],[235,242],[242,243],[244,253],[254,262],[263,267],[268,278],[279,286],[287,289],[290,295],[295,296],[297,302],[303,311],[312,318],[319,321],[322,325],[326,334],[335,340],[341,344],[345,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,357],[358,360],[361,366],[367,374],[375,380],[381,383],[384,387],[388,394],[395,398],[399,403],[404,408],[409,413],[414,418],[419,423],[424,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,441],[441,442],[443,445],[446,459],[460,467],[468,471],[472,478],[479,487],[488,490],[491,498],[499,501],[502,506],[507,512],[513,514],[514,521],[522,527],[527,528],[529,530],[530,534],[534,535],[536,539],[540,545],[546,552],[553,555],[556,560],[560,561],[561,562],[563,568],[569,572],[573,575],[576,577],[577,584],[585,591],[591,592],[592,593],[594,597],[598,607],[608,610],[611,617],[618,624],[624,625],[626,631],[632,640],[641,650],[651,662],[663,665],[666,667],[668,673],[673,674],[675,679],[680,686],[686,687],[688,693],[694,696],[697,700],[701,709],[710,720],[721,723],[724,727],[728,735],[736,740],[740,741],[742,746],[747,749],[750,753],[754,762],[763,774],[775,777],[778,779],[780,785],[786,792],[793,795],[796,800],[801,802],[803,807],[808,814],[814,815],[816,819],[820,830],[831,838],[839,849],[850,853],[854,857],[858,866],[867,869],[870,881],[881,882],[883,887],[888,890],[891,894],[895,901],[902,904],[905,911],[911,912],[913,916],[917,922],[923,928],[929,932],[933,939],[940,945],[946,949],[950,960],[961,964],[965,967],[968,971],[972,977],[978,980],[981,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,996],[997,1002],[1003,1006],[1007,1017],[1018,1024],[1025,1032],[1033,1036],[1037,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1044],[1045,1056],[1057,1066],[1067,1072],[1073,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1083],[1083,1084],[1085,1094],[1095,1098],[1099,1104],[1105,1107],[1108,1112],[1113,1120],[1121,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1138],[1139,1142],[1143,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1164],[1165,1168],[1169,1179],[1179,1181],[1182,1186],[1187,1194],[1195,1198],[1199,1209],[1210,1212],[1213,1216],[1217,1223],[1223,1224],[1225,1229],[1230,1241],[1242,1249],[1250,1251],[1252,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1270],[1271,1274],[1275,1281],[1282,1284],[1285,1290],[1291,1293],[1294,1301],[1301,1302]],"answers":["unnatural","unnatural","natural motion","unnatural","continued application of a force","unnatural"],"uuid":"57373d0cc3c5551400e51e89"},"1312":{"context":"The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a \"tiger team\" to investigate North American's problems and identify corrections.

To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones, these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan) completed in 1863, none of this decoration survives, part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006.

The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864\u201369. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance, much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic, this north fa\u00e7ade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble & Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting: Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); Titian (painting); thus representing the range of the museums collections, Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Fa\u00e7ade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum, this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.","question":"Who designed the bronze doors used as the main entrance to the museum?","spans":[[0,2],[3,12],[13,19],[20,22],[23,33],[34,37],[38,47],[48,51],[52,57],[58,61],[62,67],[67,68],[69,70],[71,77],[78,80],[81,87],[88,95],[96,105],[106,112],[113,121],[122,129],[130,132],[133,136],[137,145],[146,149],[150,161],[162,168],[168,169],[170,175],[176,180],[181,184],[185,189],[190,197],[198,200],[201,206],[207,212],[213,215],[216,219],[220,226],[226,227],[228,232],[233,240],[241,245],[246,247],[248,254],[255,257],[258,266],[267,269],[270,274],[275,283],[283,284],[285,295],[296,300],[301,303],[304,311],[312,314],[315,318],[319,328],[329,332],[333,343],[344,348],[349,356],[357,359],[360,365],[365,366],[367,372],[373,376],[377,384],[385,388],[389,394],[395,403],[403,404],[405,407],[408,411],[412,416],[417,419],[420,424],[425,429],[430,440],[441,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,466],[467,469],[470,475],[476,479],[480,483],[484,488],[489,491],[492,499],[500,508],[509,513],[514,519],[519,520],[521,526],[527,531],[532,535],[536,544],[545,551],[552,553],[553,561],[562,567],[567,568],[569,574],[575,578],[579,584],[584,585],[586,595],[596,598],[599,603],[603,604],[605,609],[610,612],[613,617],[618,628],[629,637],[637,638],[639,643],[644,646],[647,652],[653,662],[663,669],[670,673],[674,677],[678,687],[688,696],[697,700],[701,705],[706,713],[713,714],[715,721],[722,724],[725,733],[734,738],[738,739],[740,743],[744,748],[749,753],[754,756],[757,762],[763,766],[767,770],[771,777],[778,781],[782,785],[786,791],[792,794],[795,804],[805,807],[808,811],[812,817],[818,821],[822,826],[827,832],[833,835],[836,839],[840,846],[846,847],[848,852],[853,861],[862,865],[866,877],[878,883],[883,884],[885,895],[896,898],[899,902],[903,909],[910,914],[915,917],[918,922],[922,923],[924,928],[929,932],[933,939],[940,947],[948,953],[953,954],[955,956],[956,958],[959,962],[963,967],[968,971],[972,980],[981,988],[988,989],[989,990],[991,994],[995,998],[999,1004],[1005,1008],[1009,1010],[1011,1019],[1020,1027],[1028,1035],[1036,1044],[1045,1049],[1050,1052],[1053,1059],[1060,1064],[1065,1067],[1068,1071],[1072,1079],[1080,1086],[1086,1087],[1088,1091],[1092,1099],[1100,1109],[1110,1112],[1113,1116],[1117,1126],[1127,1133],[1134,1136],[1137,1141],[1142,1147],[1148,1150],[1151,1160],[1161,1164],[1165,1173],[1174,1176],[1177,1179],[1180,1182],[1183,1188],[1189,1192],[1193,1196],[1197,1210],[1211,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1229],[1230,1233],[1234,1242],[1243,1250],[1250,1251],[1252,1255],[1256,1259],[1260,1264],[1265,1267],[1268,1271],[1272,1277],[1278,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1296],[1297,1300],[1301,1306],[1307,1309],[1310,1317],[1317,1318],[1319,1322],[1323,1328],[1329,1336],[1337,1340],[1341,1345],[1346,1350],[1351,1353],[1354,1357],[1358,1364],[1365,1368],[1369,1376],[1377,1388],[1388,1389],[1390,1394],[1395,1398],[1399,1402],[1403,1407],[1408,1410],[1411,1421],[1421,1422],[1423,1428],[1429,1432],[1433,1439],[1439,1440],[1441,1445],[1446,1451],[1452,1458],[1459,1462],[1463,1471],[1472,1474],[1475,1478],[1479,1483],[1484,1492],[1493,1495],[1496,1499],[1500,1506],[1507,1511],[1512,1515],[1516,1522],[1523,1528],[1529,1537],[1538,1540],[1541,1546],[1547,1553],[1554,1555],[1556,1562],[1563,1570],[1571,1577],[1578,1581],[1582,1588],[1589,1598],[1598,1599],[1600,1607],[1608,1612],[1613,1614],[1614,1623],[1623,1624],[1624,1625],[1626,1631],[1632,1638],[1639,1640],[1640,1649],[1649,1650],[1650,1651],[1652,1657],[1658,1662],[1663,1664],[1664,1673],[1673,1674],[1674,1675],[1676,1684],[1685,1686],[1686,1698],[1698,1699],[1699,1700],[1701,1713],[1714,1715],[1715,1724],[1724,1725],[1725,1726],[1727,1733],[1734,1735],[1735,1743],[1743,1744],[1744,1745],[1746,1750],[1751,1763],[1764,1767],[1768,1773],[1774,1776],[1777,1780],[1781,1788],[1789,1800],[1800,1801],[1802,1809],[1810,1815],[1816,1820],[1821,1829],[1830,1833],[1834,1844],[1845,1859],[1860,1863],[1864,1867],[1868,1874],[1875,1877],[1878,1881],[1882,1890],[1891,1893],[1894,1897],[1898,1903],[1904,1910],[1911,1924],[1925,1928],[1929,1934],[1935,1945],[1946,1949],[1950,1957],[1958,1962],[1963,1968],[1969,1975],[1976,1978],[1979,1983],[1984,1987],[1988,1994],[1994,1995],[1996,2000],[2001,2003],[2004,2011],[2012,2014],[2015,2025],[2026,2032],[2033,2039],[2040,2042],[2043,2051],[2052,2056],[2056,2057],[2058,2062],[2063,2071],[2072,2080],[2081,2089],[2090,2094],[2095,2100],[2100,2101],[2102,2107],[2108,2113],[2114,2118],[2119,2121],[2122,2132],[2133,2135],[2136,2140],[2141,2144],[2145,2148],[2149,2152],[2153,2158],[2159,2164],[2164,2165]],"answers":["James Gamble & Reuben Townroe","James Gamble & Reuben Townroe","James Gamble & Reuben Townroe"],"uuid":"57269c06708984140094cba3"},"1718":{"context":"Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.

After nearly a decade of ratings trouble, NBC had regained the ratings lead among the Big Three networks in 1984 on the success of series such as The Cosby Show, Cheers and Miami Vice. To counteract NBC, ABC decided to refocus itself on comedies and family-oriented series beginning in the mid-1980s including Mr. Belvedere, Roseanne, Who's the Boss?, Just the Ten of Us, The Wonder Years, Full House and Perfect Strangers. The tragedy of Central Park for NBC ended its broadcast run in 1987.","question":"What comedy for ABC ended its broadcast run in 1986?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,9],[10,21],[22,24],[25,34],[34,35],[36,40],[41,43],[44,47],[47,49],[50,57],[58,63],[64,66],[67,70],[71,76],[77,82],[83,88],[89,93],[94,100],[101,104],[105,114],[114,115],[116,123],[124,125],[126,133],[134,139],[140,143],[144,147],[148,150],[151,155],[155,156],[157,162],[163,167],[168,171],[172,177],[177,179],[180,187],[188,193],[194,196],[197,201],[202,203],[203,207],[208,211],[212,218],[219,228],[229,230],[231,236],[236,237],[237,242],[243,250],[251,255],[256,260],[260,261],[261,262],[263,268],[269,272],[273,277],[278,282],[283,288],[289,292],[293,296],[297,299],[300,304],[304,305],[306,311],[312,318],[319,320],[321,327],[328,330],[331,338],[339,346],[346,347],[348,351],[352,355],[356,364],[365,368],[369,376],[377,381],[382,387],[388,391],[392,395],[396,401],[402,410],[411,413],[414,418],[419,421],[422,425],[426,433],[434,436],[437,443],[444,448],[449,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,466],[466,467],[468,474],[475,478],[479,484],[485,489],[489,490],[491,493],[494,504],[505,508],[508,509],[510,513],[514,521],[522,524],[525,532],[533,539],[540,542],[543,551],[552,555],[556,562],[562,563],[563,571],[572,578],[579,588],[589,591],[592,595],[596,605],[606,615],[616,619],[620,629],[629,630],[631,639],[639,640],[641,644],[644,646],[647,650],[651,655],[655,656],[656,657],[658,662],[663,666],[667,670],[671,673],[674,676],[676,677],[678,681],[682,688],[689,694],[694,695],[696,700],[701,706],[707,710],[711,718],[719,728],[728,729],[730,733],[734,741],[742,744],[745,752],[753,757],[758,761],[762,765],[766,771],[772,775],[776,785],[786,789],[790,792],[793,797],[797,798]],"answers":["The Love Boat","The Love Boat","The Love Boat"],"uuid":"57277585708984140094de2e-high-conf-turk4"},"3177":{"context":"Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978, an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that the majority of the Scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 March 1979 that represented at least 40% of the total electorate.

The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.","question":"What religion were the Normans","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427]],"answers":["Catholic","Catholic orthodoxy","Catholic"],"uuid":"56dddf4066d3e219004dad61"},"2724":{"context":"In 1975, Season 11 of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial.

As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.","question":"What day was the Super Bowl played on?","spans":[[0,5],[6,10],[11,13],[14,17],[18,20],[21,29],[30,38],[39,43],[44,46],[47,56],[57,60],[61,69],[70,72],[73,76],[77,85],[86,94],[95,101],[102,103],[103,106],[106,107],[108,111],[112,115],[116,120],[121,127],[127,128],[129,132],[133,141],[142,150],[151,161],[162,163],[163,166],[166,167],[168,176],[177,183],[184,191],[192,200],[201,204],[205,213],[214,222],[223,233],[234,235],[235,238],[238,239],[240,248],[249,257],[258,266],[267,272],[273,275],[276,280],[281,286],[287,292],[293,298],[299,303],[304,309],[309,310],[311,314],[315,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,333],[334,342],[343,344],[344,345],[346,350],[350,351],[352,354],[355,359],[359,361],[362,369],[370,372],[373,376],[377,380],[381,390],[391,394],[395,399],[400,402],[403,408],[409,414],[414,415],[416,426],[426,427],[428,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,454],[455,459],[459,460],[461,464],[465,471],[472,482],[483,486],[487,488],[488,494],[495,506],[506,507],[508,512],[513,520],[521,525],[525,526],[526,532],[533,544],[544,545],[546,548],[549,553],[554,556],[557,568],[569,579],[580,583],[584,593],[594,596],[597,603],[604,608],[609,614],[615,619],[620,624],[625,629],[630,635],[636,644],[645,646],[646,651],[652,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,672],[673,677],[678,682],[683,688],[689,691],[692,693],[693,698],[699,703],[704,705],[705,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,711],[712,716],[717,720],[721,725],[726,731],[732,743],[744,751],[752,755],[756,762],[763,771],[772,774],[774,775]],"answers":["February 7, 2016","February 7","February 7, 2016"],"uuid":"56bea9923aeaaa14008c91bb"},"2826":{"context":"Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars.

Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived. Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began. The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days.

Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\". Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications. The affair caused lasting damage to Luther's reputation.","question":"What did Luther get implicated in concerning Philip I?","spans":[[0,4],[5,13],[14,18],[18,19],[20,26],[27,33],[34,44],[45,47],[48,51],[52,58],[59,61],[62,68],[69,70],[70,71],[72,81],[82,84],[85,90],[90,91],[92,95],[96,102],[103,105],[106,111],[112,115],[116,118],[119,122],[123,127],[127,129],[130,136],[136,137],[137,139],[139,140],[140,147],[147,148],[149,155],[156,165],[166,169],[170,178],[179,181],[182,188],[188,189],[190,201],[201,202],[203,206],[207,212],[212,213],[214,220],[221,223],[224,225],[226,235],[236,239],[240,248],[249,251],[252,255],[256,266],[266,267],[268,271],[272,283],[284,288],[289,292],[293,301],[302,304],[305,309],[310,311],[312,319],[320,326],[326,327],[328,331],[332,336],[337,348],[349,356],[357,360],[361,370],[371,375],[376,378],[379,381],[382,385],[386,396],[396,397],[398,400],[401,407],[408,413],[414,422],[423,426],[427,431],[432,437],[438,443],[444,447],[448,454],[454,455],[456,458],[459,460],[461,467],[467,468],[469,471],[472,473],[474,479],[480,484],[484,485],[486,492],[493,500],[501,502],[503,509],[510,514],[514,515],[516,526],[527,530],[531,534],[535,540],[540,541],[542,546],[547,558],[559,562],[563,568],[569,574],[575,578],[579,588],[588,589],[590,597],[597,598],[599,605],[606,609],[610,616],[617,619],[620,624],[625,628],[629,637],[638,644],[644,645],[646,649],[650,652],[653,663],[664,666],[667,671],[672,678],[678,680],[681,687],[688,694],[694,695],[696,702],[703,707],[708,711],[712,714],[715,716],[716,720],[721,722],[723,727],[727,728],[729,735],[736,739],[739,740],[741,744],[745,749],[750,753],[754,762],[763,773],[773,774],[775,780],[781,787],[788,791],[792,798],[799,802],[803,813],[814,820],[821,832],[832,833],[834,836],[837,840],[841,845],[846,848],[849,855],[855,857],[858,868],[869,875],[876,882],[882,883],[884,885],[885,891],[892,904],[905,911],[912,915],[916,922],[923,925],[926,931],[932,935],[936,939],[940,942],[943,946],[947,952],[953,961],[962,968],[969,973],[973,974],[975,978],[978,979],[980,984],[985,987],[988,991],[992,1001],[1002,1009],[1009,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1018],[1019,1027],[1028,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1046],[1046,1047],[1048,1055],[1056,1063],[1064,1069],[1070,1076],[1077,1088],[1088,1089],[1089,1090],[1091,1097],[1098,1104],[1105,1109],[1110,1116],[1116,1118],[1119,1126],[1127,1130],[1131,1134],[1135,1139],[1140,1142],[1143,1147],[1148,1155],[1156,1164],[1165,1171],[1171,1172],[1173,1176],[1177,1181],[1182,1184],[1185,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1212],[1213,1225],[1225,1226],[1227,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1244],[1245,1252],[1253,1259],[1260,1262],[1263,1269],[1269,1271],[1272,1282],[1282,1283]],"answers":["bigamy","bigamy","bigamy"],"uuid":"56f8ac579e9bad19000a02ba"},"937":{"context":"Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007\u201308 season.

The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture, the most notable are the Great Theater (1825\u20131833) and buildings located at Bank Square (1825\u20131828).","question":"When was the Palace on the Water rebuilt?","spans":[[0,8],[9,17],[18,26],[27,29],[30,38],[39,44],[45,52],[53,56],[57,65],[66,72],[73,76],[77,82],[83,90],[91,93],[94,97],[98,102],[103,110],[110,111],[112,115],[116,118],[119,122],[123,127],[128,136],[137,139],[140,144],[145,157],[158,161],[162,171],[172,178],[179,180],[180,189],[189,190],[190,191],[192,199],[200,206],[207,208],[208,217],[217,218],[219,222],[223,226],[227,236],[237,243],[244,245],[245,254],[254,255],[255,256],[257,260],[261,265],[266,276],[277,285],[286,288],[289,295],[296,308],[309,312],[313,320],[321,327],[328,329],[329,338],[338,339],[339,340],[341,347],[348,350],[351,354],[355,359],[360,365],[366,367],[367,372],[372,373],[374,377],[378,391],[392,398],[399,400],[400,406],[407,416],[416,417],[417,418],[419,422],[423,435],[436,448],[449,451],[452,458],[459,462],[463,465],[466,475],[476,478],[479,482],[483,493],[494,496],[497,500],[501,512],[513,518],[519,525],[526,530],[531,532],[533,538],[539,550],[551,555],[556,559],[560,565],[566,572],[572,573],[574,578],[579,581],[582,585],[586,590],[591,599],[600,602],[603,606],[607,619],[620,625],[626,629],[630,633],[634,640],[641,643],[644,647],[648,653],[654,655],[655,662],[663,672],[672,673],[673,674],[675,686],[687,688],[688,697],[697,698],[698,699],[700,709],[710,716],[717,718],[718,724],[725,734],[734,735],[736,739],[740,751],[752,756],[757,764],[765,771],[772,773],[773,782],[782,783],[783,784],[785,788],[789,797],[798,804],[805,811],[812,815],[816,821],[822,827],[828,830],[831,839],[840,846],[847,853],[854,855],[856,861],[862,866],[867,879],[879,880],[881,884],[885,897],[898,905],[906,914],[915,918],[919,926],[927,929],[930,942],[942,943],[944,947],[948,952],[953,960],[961,964],[965,968],[969,974],[975,982],[983,984],[984,993],[993,994],[995,998],[999,1008],[1009,1016],[1017,1019],[1020,1024],[1025,1031],[1032,1033],[1033,1042],[1042,1043],[1043,1044]],"answers":["1775\u20131795","1696","1775\u20131795"],"uuid":"573362b94776f41900660978"},"544":{"context":"In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons.

Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier.

However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.","question":" What may have caused rainforests to grow across South America?","spans":[[0,9],[10,13],[14,24],[24,25],[25,34],[35,45],[46,51],[51,52],[53,56],[57,67],[68,70],[71,74],[75,84],[85,88],[89,92],[93,99],[100,107],[108,111],[112,116],[117,124],[125,128],[129,137],[138,148],[149,151],[152,158],[159,162],[163,169],[170,173],[174,183],[183,184],[185,189],[190,195],[196,199],[199,200],[201,204],[205,215],[216,224],[225,227],[228,231],[232,237],[238,240],[241,243],[243,244],[244,245],[246,253],[254,266],[267,273],[274,277],[278,282],[283,285],[286,293],[294,299],[300,304],[305,312],[313,320],[321,328],[329,331],[332,338],[339,343],[344,347],[348,355],[355,356],[357,363],[364,367],[368,377],[377,378],[379,382],[383,390],[390,391],[392,395],[396,406],[407,414],[415,416],[417,427],[428,434],[435,439],[439,440],[441,443],[444,452],[453,458],[459,465],[466,469],[470,476],[477,484],[484,485],[486,490],[491,500],[501,503],[504,505],[506,512],[513,519],[520,529],[530,532],[533,536],[537,541],[542,549],[550,557],[557,558],[559,566],[566,567],[568,571],[572,582],[583,588],[589,596],[597,599],[600,606],[607,613],[614,619],[620,627],[628,635],[635,636],[637,645],[646,649],[650,653],[654,662],[663,666],[667,676],[677,679],[680,681],[682,687],[688,697],[698,700],[701,708],[708,709]],"answers":["the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate","extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate","extinction of the dinosaurs"],"uuid":"57283adcff5b5019007d9f94"},"1305":{"context":"The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water.

Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates (including stations in Boston, Kansas City, Milwaukee and West Palm Beach) on the service.","question":"What were the first local stations to offer streams of their programming on WATCH ABC?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,11],[11,12],[13,16],[17,25],[26,27],[27,32],[33,36],[36,37],[37,38],[39,40],[41,47],[48,50],[51,54],[55,66],[67,72],[72,73],[73,81],[82,91],[92,100],[101,113],[114,117],[118,125],[125,127],[128,136],[137,146],[147,153],[154,156],[157,164],[165,168],[169,170],[171,177],[178,181],[182,185],[186,197],[198,201],[202,208],[209,218],[218,219],[220,222],[223,231],[232,234],[235,244],[245,249],[249,250],[250,256],[257,265],[266,268],[269,272],[273,281],[281,282],[283,286],[287,294],[295,301],[302,306],[307,318],[319,326],[327,329],[330,335],[336,339],[340,350],[351,353],[354,360],[361,368],[369,370],[370,373],[374,379],[380,384],[385,393],[394,396],[397,398],[399,403],[404,413],[414,421],[421,422],[422,423],[424,431],[432,434],[435,441],[442,449],[450,454],[454,456],[457,466],[467,474],[475,476],[476,481],[482,492],[493,496],[497,498],[498,503],[503,504],[505,510],[511,515],[516,518],[519,522],[523,532],[533,541],[542,544],[545,551],[551,553],[554,564],[565,573],[573,574],[574,575],[576,580],[581,588],[589,591],[592,595],[596,604],[605,608],[609,613],[614,623],[624,626],[627,640],[641,652],[653,655],[656,669],[670,673],[674,684],[685,694],[695,697],[698,705],[706,713],[713,714],[715,718],[719,723],[724,728],[729,732],[733,737],[737,738],[738,740],[741,744],[745,757],[758,761],[762,766],[766,767],[767,769],[770,774],[775,778],[779,784],[785,793],[794,796],[797,802],[803,810],[811,813],[814,819],[820,831],[832,834],[835,838],[839,846],[847,848],[848,852],[853,854],[855,859],[860,867],[868,871],[872,875],[875,876],[876,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[905,906],[906,907],[908,912],[913,916],[917,920],[921,930],[931,934],[935,939],[940,948],[949,956],[957,959],[960,963],[964,969],[970,972],[973,976],[977,984],[985,991],[991,992],[993,999],[1000,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1023],[1024,1025],[1026,1030],[1031,1033],[1034,1039],[1040,1047],[1048,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1058],[1059,1069],[1070,1071],[1071,1080],[1081,1089],[1090,1092],[1093,1099],[1099,1100],[1101,1107],[1108,1112],[1112,1113],[1114,1123],[1124,1127],[1128,1132],[1133,1137],[1138,1143],[1143,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1151],[1152,1159],[1159,1160]],"answers":["New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV","New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV","WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV"],"uuid":"57277af2708984140094dec4"},"517":{"context":"He produced artificial lightning, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long.

The amount of Acadian colonists declined after 1675.","question":"The number of new Huguenot colonists declined after what year?","spans":[[0,10],[11,20],[21,28],[29,31],[32,35],[36,40],[41,43],[44,48],[49,53],[54,58],[59,61],[62,67],[68,70],[71,75],[76,80],[81,84],[85,92],[93,95],[96,104],[105,112],[113,114],[114,121],[121,122],[122,123],[124,127],[128,133],[134,142],[143,145],[146,152],[153,155],[156,159],[160,164],[165,167],[168,172],[173,177],[178,181],[182,189],[190,195],[196,198],[199,201],[202,212],[212,213],[214,218],[219,221],[222,231],[232,235],[236,239],[240,248],[249,250],[250,253],[254,262],[263,265],[266,267],[268,275],[276,282],[283,291],[291,292],[292,293],[294,297],[298,305],[306,308],[309,310],[311,316],[317,321],[322,324],[325,334],[335,336],[337,347],[348,350],[351,355],[356,358],[359,364],[365,369],[370,374],[374,375],[376,379],[380,386],[387,391],[392,395],[396,399],[400,403],[404,408],[409,412],[413,418],[419,424],[424,425],[426,428],[429,431],[432,440],[441,445],[446,449],[450,455],[456,465],[466,471],[472,474],[475,484],[485,488],[489,493],[494,498],[499,502],[503,514],[515,517],[518,521],[522,527],[528,532],[533,538],[539,546],[547,551],[552,554],[555,558],[559,563],[564,566],[567,571],[572,576],[576,577],[578,581],[582,589],[590,597],[598,600],[601,604],[605,614],[615,617],[618,624],[625,627],[628,631],[632,636],[637,644],[645,652],[653,657],[658,661],[662,666],[667,669],[670,675],[676,681],[682,684],[685,689],[690,692],[693,696],[697,706],[707,716],[716,717],[718,721],[722,727],[728,729],[730,733],[734,741],[742,744],[745,749],[750,752],[753,757],[757,758],[759,769],[769,770],[771,774],[775,782],[783,791],[792,795],[796,800],[801,806],[807,813],[814,821],[822,824],[825,826],[827,831],[831,832],[833,836],[837,843],[844,846],[847,854],[855,864],[865,873],[874,879],[880,884],[884,885]],"answers":["1700","1700","1700"],"uuid":"571077ecb654c5140001f90d-high-conf-turk2"},"1722":{"context":"Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth.

More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan.

Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land.

Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London.

The Assembly has 78 days to nominate a Second Prime after a General Vote.","question":"How many days does the Parliament have to nominate a First Minister after a General Election?","spans":[[0,5],[6,9],[10,18],[19,22],[23,27],[27,28],[29,37],[38,45],[46,55],[56,59],[60,63],[64,72],[73,83],[84,87],[88,92],[93,95],[96,99],[100,105],[106,114],[115,117],[118,121],[122,127],[128,132],[133,138],[139,140],[140,144],[144,145],[146,150],[150,151],[152,156],[157,160],[161,163],[164,166],[166,167],[167,168],[169,172],[173,177],[178,180],[181,184],[185,189],[190,193],[194,196],[197,203],[204,206],[207,209],[210,212],[213,216],[217,222],[223,229],[230,233],[234,236],[237,240],[241,248],[249,251],[252,255],[256,264],[265,267],[268,271],[272,281],[282,289],[289,290],[291,293],[294,297],[298,308],[309,315],[316,324],[325,329],[330,332],[333,339],[340,342],[343,352],[353,354],[354,358],[359,361],[362,367],[368,371],[371,372],[372,378],[379,381],[382,385],[386,393],[394,400],[401,403],[404,410],[410,411],[411,412],[413,415],[416,418],[419,422],[423,433],[434,439],[440,442],[443,451],[452,455],[456,458],[459,462],[463,470],[471,473],[474,476],[477,482],[483,491],[492,498],[499,501],[502,506],[507,509],[510,511],[512,519],[520,528],[529,531],[532,534],[535,538],[539,547],[548,556],[557,563],[563,564],[565,568],[569,578],[579,586],[587,595],[596,597],[598,602],[603,606],[607,609],[610,623],[624,631],[632,640],[641,644],[645,648],[649,659],[660,662],[663,672],[673,675],[676,679],[680,685],[686,688],[689,694],[695,707],[707,708],[709,722],[723,730],[731,740],[741,744],[745,747],[748,756],[757,759],[760,768],[769,776],[777,786],[786,787],[788,794],[795,799],[800,804],[805,809],[810,813],[814,820],[821,827],[828,831],[832,835],[836,840],[841,843],[844,846],[847,855],[856,863],[864,872],[872,873],[874,876],[877,882],[883,887],[888,892],[893,901],[902,904],[904,905],[906,909],[910,919],[920,928],[929,937],[938,945],[946,948],[949,952],[953,958],[959,967],[968,970],[971,974],[974,975],[976,977],[978,986],[987,989],[990,994],[995,1000],[1001,1006],[1007,1011],[1012,1013],[1013,1017],[1017,1018],[1019,1020],[1021,1024],[1025,1029],[1029,1030],[1031,1032],[1033,1036],[1037,1041],[1041,1042],[1043,1046],[1046,1047],[1047,1048],[1048,1049],[1050,1053],[1054,1062],[1063,1066],[1067,1069],[1070,1074],[1075,1077],[1078,1086],[1087,1088],[1089,1095],[1096,1101],[1102,1107],[1108,1109],[1110,1117],[1118,1122],[1122,1123]],"answers":["28","28","28 days"],"uuid":"572fd6aa04bcaa1900d76da2-high-conf-turk0"},"2265":{"context":"When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.

Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land.

Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.","question":"What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing, after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,20],[21,27],[28,30],[31,34],[35,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,61],[62,64],[65,67],[68,71],[71,72],[72,78],[79,82],[83,85],[86,89],[90,96],[97,99],[100,106],[107,108],[109,110],[110,116],[116,117],[118,121],[122,125],[126,131],[132,140],[141,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,161],[162,163],[163,164],[165,173],[174,175],[176,181],[182,183],[184,187],[188,190],[191,199],[200,201],[201,202],[203,207],[207,208],[209,212],[213,223],[224,226],[227,230],[231,238],[239,245],[245,247],[248,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,270],[271,272],[273,278],[278,279],[279,284],[285,292],[293,296],[297,309],[310,312],[313,318],[319,322],[323,330],[331,337],[338,344],[345,347],[348,351],[352,354],[355,359],[360,363],[364,374],[375,377],[378,384],[385,389],[390,393],[394,399],[400,405],[405,406],[406,413],[414,421],[422,427],[427,428],[429,433],[434,437],[438,446],[447,449],[450,455],[456,457],[457,458],[459,463],[463,464],[465,467],[468,474],[475,476],[477,478],[478,484],[484,485],[486,491],[492,499],[500,501],[502,505],[506,509],[510,511],[512,514],[515,519],[520,527],[528,530],[531,538],[538,539],[540,543],[544,550],[551,553],[554,558],[559,566],[567,570],[571,573],[574,581],[582,587],[587,588],[588,593],[594,603],[603,604],[605,613],[614,621],[622,624],[625,626],[627,636],[637,643],[643,644],[644,650],[651,656],[656,657],[658,663],[664,667],[668,675],[676,682],[683,689],[690,692],[693,700],[701,708],[709,713],[713,714],[714,719],[720,727],[727,728],[729,732],[733,739],[740,741],[742,753],[754,758],[759,770],[770,771],[772,773],[774,781],[782,788],[789,791],[792,795],[795,796],[796,802],[803,809],[810,820],[820,821],[822,827],[828,835],[836,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,853],[854,860],[861,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878],[879,882],[883,884],[884,885],[885,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[906,917],[917,918],[919,922],[923,926],[927,936],[937,944],[945,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,968],[968,969],[970,973],[974,980],[981,983],[984,987],[988,993],[994,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1022],[1022,1023],[1024,1034],[1035,1037],[1038,1042],[1043,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1063],[1063,1064],[1064,1069],[1070,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1129],[1130,1136],[1137,1143],[1144,1146],[1147,1158],[1159,1165],[1166,1169],[1170,1176],[1177,1184],[1185,1187],[1188,1194],[1195,1196],[1196,1197],[1198,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1215],[1216,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1239],[1240,1243],[1244,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1274],[1275,1280],[1281,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1294],[1295,1296],[1297,1305],[1305,1306],[1307,1311],[1312,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1331],[1332,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1346],[1347,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1362],[1363,1364],[1365,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1384],[1384,1385]],"answers":["third unmanned test","Apollo 6","third unmanned test","cancelling a third unmanned test","third unmanned test."],"uuid":"5725e08389a1e219009ac013"},"1800":{"context":"The city still contains many theatres.

A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable.

Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany (2012), shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists.","question":"Who thinks that Luther added antisemitism as a cultural element to Germany?","spans":[[0,5],[6,14],[15,20],[21,25],[25,26],[27,31],[32,34],[35,38],[39,44],[45,49],[50,56],[57,61],[61,62],[62,68],[68,69],[69,73],[74,76],[76,77],[78,85],[86,88],[89,96],[97,100],[101,104],[105,114],[115,121],[122,126],[127,130],[131,135],[136,138],[139,141],[142,148],[149,154],[154,155],[155,160],[161,169],[170,174],[175,176],[177,180],[181,188],[189,191],[192,195],[196,204],[205,214],[215,224],[225,227],[228,235],[235,236],[237,243],[244,250],[251,257],[258,262],[263,269],[270,272],[273,281],[282,286],[287,288],[288,299],[300,303],[304,313],[314,322],[323,325],[326,333],[334,337],[338,350],[351,355],[355,356],[356,364],[365,367],[368,369],[370,373],[374,381],[382,384],[385,391],[392,399],[400,403],[404,412],[413,421],[421,422],[422,423],[424,428],[429,433],[434,440],[441,445],[446,448],[449,455],[456,457],[458,459],[459,469],[470,473],[474,484],[485,494],[494,495],[496,501],[502,506],[507,509],[510,515],[516,522],[523,530],[531,534],[535,544],[544,545],[546,547],[548,557],[558,562],[563,568],[569,578],[579,583],[584,588],[589,595],[595,596],[597,608],[609,611],[612,618],[619,621],[622,625],[626,630],[631,641],[642,645],[646,650],[650,651],[652,658],[659,662],[663,666],[667,677],[678,684],[685,687],[688,692],[693,700],[701,702],[702,706],[706,707],[707,708],[709,714],[715,719],[720,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,737],[738,744],[745,753],[754,760],[761,764],[765,776],[777,783],[784,787],[788,792],[793,798],[799,804],[805,809],[810,816],[816,818],[819,826],[827,839],[840,847],[848,851],[852,856],[857,860],[861,866],[867,873],[874,882],[883,885],[886,893],[894,896],[897,902],[903,905],[906,910],[911,914],[915,919],[919,920],[920,927],[928,936],[937,939],[940,943],[944,952],[953,963],[963,964]],"answers":["Ronald Berger","Ronald Berger","Berger"],"uuid":"56f8bbb09e9bad19000a03dc"},"3009":{"context":"In February 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the Fourth Assessment Report, five climate scientists \u2013 all contributing or lead IPCC report authors \u2013 wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC.

This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.","question":"In what form are most hospital medications?","spans":[[0,8],[9,19],[20,23],[24,29],[30,32],[33,38],[39,45],[46,49],[50,58],[59,61],[62,65],[66,74],[74,75],[76,84],[85,95],[96,103],[104,109],[110,111],[112,118],[119,124],[125,127],[128,139],[139,140],[141,150],[151,155],[156,167],[168,179],[179,180],[181,185],[186,191],[192,194],[195,203],[204,206],[207,210],[211,220],[221,228],[228,229],[230,234],[235,243],[244,255],[256,259],[260,264],[264,265],[265,269],[269,270],[271,273],[274,275],[276,282],[283,287],[288,290],[291,299],[299,300],[301,309],[310,321],[322,325],[326,333],[334,342],[343,354],[355,363],[364,371],[372,380],[381,384],[385,393],[394,403],[404,409],[410,420],[421,430],[431,432],[432,435],[435,436],[436,437],[438,441],[442,447],[448,459],[460,465],[466,479],[479,480],[481,485],[486,488],[489,490],[491,498],[499,506],[507,511],[512,520],[521,529],[530,538],[539,541],[542,551],[551,552],[553,560],[561,570],[571,573],[574,582],[582,583],[584,587],[588,596],[597,607],[607,608],[609,616],[617,625],[626,636],[637,641],[642,649],[650,652],[653,662],[663,667],[668,672],[673,685],[686,689],[690,694],[695,700],[701,712],[713,722],[723,725],[726,735],[736,739],[740,750],[751,753],[754,765],[765,766],[767,770],[771,775],[776,780],[781,783],[784,795],[796,799],[800,804],[804,805],[805,812],[813,823],[823,824],[825,833],[834,838],[839,842],[843,852],[853,859],[860,862],[863,874],[875,878],[879,887],[888,896],[897,899],[900,907],[907,908],[908,912],[913,921],[922,925],[926,933],[934,940],[940,941],[942,946],[947,949],[950,960],[961,965],[966,974],[975,985],[986,993],[994,996],[997,1000],[1001,1008],[1009,1014],[1015,1023],[1023,1024]],"answers":["unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine","unit-dose","unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine"],"uuid":"5726e313f1498d1400e8eeb3"},"3309":{"context":"After al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military.

The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage.

Some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion went on to become members of the Victorian Parliament.","question":"What armed group stopped the uprising at Ballarat?","spans":[[0,2],[3,7],[8,10],[11,19],[20,25],[26,29],[30,32],[33,38],[39,48],[49,56],[57,60],[61,71],[72,74],[75,83],[84,86],[87,93],[94,104],[105,112],[113,119],[120,125],[126,127],[127,130],[131,132],[132,138],[139,147],[147,148],[148,149],[149,150],[151,155],[156,159],[160,167],[168,170],[171,178],[179,185],[185,186],[187,190],[191,194],[195,206],[207,215],[216,224],[225,236],[237,239],[240,246],[247,250],[251,265],[266,267],[267,279],[280,288],[289,292],[293,298],[299,305],[306,313],[314,318],[318,319],[320,323],[324,330],[331,334],[335,344],[344,345],[346,352],[353,354],[355,360],[361,365],[365,366],[367,370],[371,379],[380,390],[391,398],[399,407],[408,419],[420,430],[431,435],[436,439],[440,447],[448,450],[451,454],[455,461],[462,464],[465,473],[474,477],[478,482],[482,483],[484,488],[489,491],[492,495],[496,503],[504,506],[507,510],[511,517],[518,527],[528,532],[533,535],[536,538],[539,545],[546,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,570],[571,581],[581,582]],"answers":["British troops","British troops","British troops"],"uuid":"570d4c3bfed7b91900d45e33"},"3023":{"context":"The mechanism for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes. Seven minor cholorplast replication models have been suggested.","question":"How many major chloroplast replication models have been suggested?","spans":[[0,3],[4,13],[14,17],[18,29],[30,33],[34,35],[35,40],[40,41],[42,53],[54,57],[58,61],[62,66],[67,79],[80,90],[90,91],[92,95],[96,99],[100,104],[105,111],[112,116],[117,121],[122,130],[130,131],[132,142],[143,147],[148,157],[158,160],[161,168],[169,180],[181,192],[193,196],[197,205],[206,216],[217,222],[223,226],[227,232],[232,233],[234,237],[238,245],[246,248],[249,252],[253,263],[264,275],[276,279],[280,282],[283,286],[287,291],[292,296],[297,308],[309,312],[313,323],[324,329],[330,331],[332,338],[339,351],[352,356],[357,358],[358,359],[359,360],[360,364],[364,365],[365,366],[367,369],[370,373],[374,375],[375,376],[376,380],[381,386],[387,394],[395,398],[399,407],[408,411],[411,412],[413,415],[416,422],[423,424],[425,430],[431,443],[444,448],[448,449],[450,454],[455,460],[461,463],[464,465],[466,472],[473,484],[485,497],[497,498],[499,502],[503,512],[513,524],[525,529],[530,531],[532,539],[540,546],[547,556],[556,557],[558,571],[572,578],[579,581],[582,590],[591,597],[598,600],[601,607],[607,608],[609,617],[618,629],[630,635],[636,640],[641,643],[643,644],[645,653],[654,665],[666,675],[676,678],[679,689],[690,693],[694,697],[697,698],[699,701],[702,713],[714,723],[723,724],[725,728],[729,734],[735,739],[740,743],[744,754],[755,763],[763,764],[765,768],[769,772],[773,778],[779,789],[790,798],[798,799],[800,808],[809,817],[818,823],[824,835],[835,836],[837,842],[843,848],[849,860],[861,872],[873,879],[880,884],[885,889],[890,899],[899,900]],"answers":["two","two","two"],"uuid":"572969f51d046914007793de-high-conf-turk0"},"2738":{"context":"From the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multimillion-dollar expansion projects.

This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market. On May 9, 1960, WLS launched a new lineup consisting of ABC Radio programming. In 1960, Canadian entrepreneur John Bassett, who was trying to establish a television station in Toronto, sought the help of ABC to launch the station. Leonard Goldenson agreed to acquire a 25% interest in CFTO-TV; however, legislation by the Canadian Radio-Television Commission prohibited ABC's involvement, resulting in the company withdrawing from the project before the station's launch. Barry Herzenerg offered to invest in the LSTM project before the British Licencing Board ruled against NBC.","question":"What project did Leonard Goldenson offer to invest in before the Canadian Radio-Television Commission ruled against ABC?","spans":[[0,6],[7,10],[11,16],[16,17],[18,21],[22,31],[32,34],[35,38],[39,43],[44,48],[49,53],[54,56],[57,62],[63,65],[66,70],[71,73],[74,77],[78,87],[87,88],[89,91],[92,105],[106,109],[110,117],[118,120],[121,125],[126,128],[129,132],[133,139],[140,142],[143,147],[148,155],[156,160],[161,164],[165,171],[171,172],[173,176],[177,184],[184,186],[187,195],[196,204],[205,208],[209,216],[217,219],[220,222],[223,229],[230,232],[233,238],[239,249],[250,253],[254,265],[265,266],[267,269],[270,273],[274,278],[278,279],[280,283],[284,293],[294,301],[302,307],[308,315],[316,319],[319,320],[321,326],[327,330],[331,337],[338,345],[346,350],[351,355],[356,361],[362,365],[366,371],[371,372],[373,377],[378,389],[390,397],[398,401],[402,404],[405,416],[417,420],[421,429],[430,432],[433,436],[437,443],[443,444],[445,447],[448,451],[452,453],[453,454],[455,459],[459,460],[461,464],[465,473],[474,475],[476,479],[480,486],[487,497],[498,500],[501,504],[505,510],[511,522],[522,523],[524,526],[527,531],[531,532],[533,541],[542,554],[555,559],[560,567],[567,568],[569,572],[573,576],[577,583],[584,586],[587,596],[597,598],[599,609],[610,617],[618,620],[621,628],[628,629],[630,636],[637,640],[641,645],[646,648],[649,652],[653,655],[656,662],[663,666],[667,674],[674,675],[676,683],[684,693],[694,700],[701,703],[704,711],[712,713],[714,716],[716,717],[718,726],[727,729],[730,734],[734,735],[735,737],[737,738],[739,746],[746,747],[748,759],[760,762],[763,766],[767,775],[776,781],[781,782],[782,792],[793,803],[804,814],[815,818],[818,820],[821,832],[832,833],[834,843],[844,846],[847,850],[851,858],[859,870],[871,875],[876,879],[880,887],[888,894],[895,898],[899,906],[906,908],[909,915],[915,916],[917,922],[923,932],[933,940],[941,943],[944,950],[951,953],[954,957],[958,962],[963,970],[971,977],[978,981],[982,989],[990,999],[1000,1005],[1006,1011],[1012,1019],[1020,1023],[1023,1024]],"answers":["CFTO-TV","CFTO-TV","CFTO-TV"],"uuid":"57275e125951b619008f88da-high-conf-turk1"},"1731":{"context":"At the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods.

The fraction 1\/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q.

Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n \u2212 1)! is divisible by n. In order for 1\/p to be expressed in base q instead of base 20 it must still have a period of p-2.","question":"What condition what must be satisfied in order for 1\/p to be expressed in base q instead of base 10 and still have a period of p - 1?","spans":[[0,5],[5,7],[8,18],[19,23],[24,28],[29,33],[34,42],[43,45],[46,50],[51,52],[53,63],[64,73],[74,77],[78,79],[80,82],[83,85],[86,91],[91,92],[93,100],[101,112],[113,115],[116,122],[122,124],[125,131],[132,139],[140,142],[143,146],[147,156],[156,157],[158,160],[161,162],[163,165],[166,167],[168,173],[174,180],[181,186],[187,191],[192,193],[194,197],[198,199],[199,200],[201,204],[205,207],[208,214],[215,216],[217,226],[227,234],[234,235],[236,241],[242,248],[249,251],[252,253],[254,255],[256,257],[258,260],[261,262],[263,270],[271,273],[274,275],[276,277],[278,279],[279,280],[281,284],[285,293],[294,297],[298,307],[308,316],[317,319],[320,324],[325,326],[327,328],[328,334],[335,339],[340,344],[345,347],[347,348],[349,352],[353,360],[361,367],[367,368],[369,377],[378,382],[383,384],[385,387],[388,391],[392,393],[394,399],[400,406],[407,409],[410,412],[413,419],[419,421],[422,429],[430,434],[435,439],[440,442],[443,450],[451,452],[453,454],[455,456],[457,459],[460,465],[466,468],[469,472],[473,477],[478,480],[481,484],[485,494],[495,496],[496,497],[498,499],[500,501],[501,502],[502,503],[504,505],[506,507],[508,510],[511,520],[521,523],[524,526],[527,535],[535,536],[537,539],[540,547],[548,549],[550,551],[552,553],[554,556],[557,566],[567,569],[570,573],[574,578],[579,581],[582,583],[583,584],[585,586],[587,588],[588,589],[589,590],[591,593],[594,603],[604,606],[607,609],[610,612],[613,618],[619,622],[623,626],[627,629],[630,632],[633,642],[643,645],[646,650],[651,652],[653,660],[661,663],[664,668],[669,671],[672,674],[675,679],[680,685],[686,690],[691,692],[693,699],[700,702],[703,706],[706,707]],"answers":["p is not a prime factor of q","p is not a prime factor of q","p is not a prime factor of q","p is not a prime factor of q.","p is not a prime factor of q."],"uuid":"572995d46aef051400154fec-high-conf-turk2"},"445":{"context":"In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship.

During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later he was known to play billiards in the US.

The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.","question":"What increases entrepreneurship rates at the individual level?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,12],[13,17],[17,18],[19,25],[26,34],[35,45],[46,51],[52,54],[55,63],[64,80],[81,86],[87,89],[90,93],[94,104],[105,110],[111,112],[112,116],[116,117],[117,127],[127,128],[128,129],[130,137],[137,138],[139,143],[144,146],[147,149],[150,152],[153,158],[159,164],[165,167],[168,177],[178,184],[185,189],[190,201],[201,202],[203,212],[212,213],[213,218],[219,235],[236,238],[239,248],[249,251],[252,260],[261,266],[267,271],[272,274],[275,281],[282,285],[286,290],[291,294],[295,302],[303,304],[304,305],[305,309],[309,310],[311,322],[322,323],[323,324],[325,332],[333,344],[344,345],[345,350],[351,367],[368,370],[371,377],[378,380],[381,392],[392,393],[393,401],[402,413],[414,415],[415,416],[416,420],[420,421],[421,422],[423,427],[428,430],[431,439],[440,443],[444,448],[449,455],[456,458],[459,466],[467,470],[471,477],[478,480],[481,484],[485,493],[493,494],[495,503],[503,504],[505,507],[508,519],[520,526],[527,532],[532,533],[534,537],[538,546],[547,553],[554,556],[557,560],[561,567],[568,572],[573,575],[576,594],[595,600],[601,603],[604,606],[607,621],[622,627],[628,631],[632,638],[639,641],[642,650],[651,653],[654,660],[661,674],[675,683],[684,687],[688,692],[693,697],[698,699],[700,704],[705,713],[714,720],[721,723],[724,732],[733,739],[739,740]],"answers":["higher economic inequality","higher economic inequality","higher economic inequality"],"uuid":"5729de24af94a219006aa689"},"1319":{"context":"The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test. After the Gemini 4 testing, a further 8 unmanned tests were cancelled due to the Titan cellpadding being insufficient to hold men safely.","question":"What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing, after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?","spans":[[0,3],[4,9],[10,12],[13,16],[17,20],[21,27],[28,30],[31,34],[35,39],[40,47],[48,52],[53,55],[56,61],[62,64],[65,67],[68,71],[71,72],[72,78],[79,82],[83,85],[86,89],[90,96],[97,99],[100,106],[107,108],[109,110],[110,116],[116,117],[118,121],[122,125],[126,131],[132,140],[141,147],[148,150],[151,154],[155,161],[162,163],[163,164],[165,173],[174,175],[176,181],[182,183],[184,187],[188,190],[191,199],[200,201],[201,202],[203,207],[207,208],[209,212],[213,223],[224,226],[227,230],[231,238],[239,245],[245,247],[248,252],[253,259],[260,262],[263,270],[271,272],[273,278],[278,279],[279,284],[285,292],[293,296],[297,309],[310,312],[313,318],[319,322],[323,330],[331,337],[338,344],[345,347],[348,351],[352,354],[355,359],[360,363],[364,374],[375,377],[378,384],[385,389],[390,393],[394,399],[400,405],[405,406],[406,413],[414,421],[422,427],[427,428],[429,433],[434,437],[438,446],[447,449],[450,455],[456,457],[457,458],[459,463],[463,464],[465,467],[468,474],[475,476],[477,478],[478,484],[484,485],[486,491],[492,499],[500,501],[502,505],[506,509],[510,511],[512,514],[515,519],[520,527],[528,530],[531,538],[538,539],[540,543],[544,550],[551,553],[554,558],[559,566],[567,570],[571,573],[574,581],[582,587],[587,588],[588,593],[594,603],[603,604],[605,613],[614,621],[622,624],[625,626],[627,636],[637,643],[643,644],[644,650],[651,656],[656,657],[658,663],[664,667],[668,675],[676,682],[683,689],[690,692],[693,700],[701,708],[709,713],[713,714],[714,719],[720,727],[727,728],[729,732],[733,739],[740,741],[742,753],[754,758],[759,770],[770,771],[772,773],[774,781],[782,788],[789,791],[792,795],[795,796],[796,802],[803,809],[810,820],[820,821],[822,827],[828,835],[836,840],[841,846],[847,849],[850,853],[854,860],[861,864],[865,870],[871,877],[877,878],[879,882],[883,884],[884,885],[885,887],[888,895],[896,900],[901,905],[906,917],[917,918],[919,922],[923,926],[927,936],[937,944],[945,949],[950,954],[955,957],[958,968],[968,969],[970,973],[974,980],[981,983],[984,987],[988,993],[994,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1010],[1011,1015],[1016,1022],[1022,1023],[1024,1034],[1035,1037],[1038,1042],[1043,1053],[1054,1057],[1058,1063],[1063,1064],[1064,1069],[1070,1079],[1079,1080],[1081,1088],[1089,1100],[1101,1105],[1106,1110],[1111,1113],[1114,1117],[1118,1121],[1122,1129],[1130,1136],[1137,1143],[1144,1146],[1147,1158],[1159,1165],[1166,1169],[1170,1176],[1177,1184],[1185,1187],[1188,1194],[1195,1196],[1196,1197],[1198,1203],[1204,1206],[1207,1210],[1211,1215],[1216,1227],[1228,1230],[1231,1237],[1238,1239],[1240,1243],[1244,1258],[1259,1261],[1262,1274],[1275,1280],[1281,1283],[1284,1287],[1288,1294],[1295,1296],[1297,1305],[1305,1306],[1307,1311],[1312,1320],[1321,1324],[1325,1331],[1332,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1346],[1347,1350],[1350,1351],[1352,1362],[1363,1364],[1365,1370],[1371,1379],[1380,1384],[1384,1385],[1386,1391],[1392,1395],[1396,1402],[1403,1404],[1405,1412],[1412,1413],[1414,1415],[1416,1423],[1424,1425],[1426,1434],[1435,1440],[1441,1445],[1446,1455],[1456,1459],[1460,1462],[1463,1466],[1467,1472],[1473,1484],[1485,1490],[1491,1503],[1504,1506],[1507,1511],[1512,1515],[1516,1522],[1522,1523]],"answers":["third unmanned test","Apollo 6","third unmanned test","cancelling a third unmanned test","third unmanned test."],"uuid":"5725e08389a1e219009ac013-high-conf-turk1"},"1856":{"context":"In the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade. A walkway was constructed between 1977 and 1981 to link the Edward Wright wing to the rest of the museum.","question":"What was constructed between 1978 and 1982 to link the Henry Cole wing to the rest of the museum?","spans":[[0,2],[3,6],[7,16],[17,21],[21,22],[22,25],[26,31],[32,37],[38,41],[42,48],[49,54],[55,64],[65,68],[69,74],[75,79],[80,89],[90,97],[97,98],[99,102],[103,108],[109,112],[113,118],[119,124],[125,128],[129,135],[136,138],[139,142],[143,146],[147,149],[150,158],[159,163],[163,164],[165,168],[169,174],[175,180],[181,185],[186,189],[190,193],[194,202],[203,205],[206,209],[210,217],[218,223],[224,227],[228,233],[234,236],[237,240],[241,244],[245,252],[253,255],[256,260],[261,264],[265,269],[269,270],[271,275],[276,284],[285,293],[294,298],[299,304],[305,309],[309,311],[312,316],[317,321],[322,324],[325,329],[330,333],[334,338],[339,345],[345,346],[347,351],[352,353],[354,357],[358,366],[367,374],[375,377],[378,381],[382,388],[389,394],[395,396],[396,399],[400,403],[404,408],[408,409],[410,416],[417,419],[420,424],[424,425],[425,426],[427,431],[432,435],[436,441],[442,448],[448,449],[449,454],[455,464],[465,467],[468,471],[472,477],[477,478],[478,482],[483,487],[488,490],[491,494],[495,501],[502,506],[507,517],[517,518],[519,526],[527,529],[530,534],[535,537],[538,542],[543,546],[547,550],[551,560],[561,569],[570,581],[582,585],[586,595],[596,597],[597,601],[602,613],[613,614],[615,622],[623,630],[631,637],[638,641],[642,645],[645,646],[646,655],[655,656],[656,657],[658,660],[661,665],[666,669],[670,676],[677,680],[681,689],[690,694],[695,697],[698,701],[702,705],[706,711],[712,716],[717,721],[722,726],[727,730],[731,736],[737,744],[745,747],[748,755],[755,756],[757,759],[760,765],[766,768],[769,774],[775,778],[779,787],[788,790],[791,800],[800,801],[802,805],[806,809],[810,819],[820,829],[830,836],[837,840],[841,844],[845,854],[855,859],[860,866],[867,873],[874,877],[878,889],[889,890],[891,893],[894,898],[899,903],[904,906],[907,910],[911,915],[916,918],[919,922],[923,929],[929,930],[931,932],[933,936],[937,945],[946,954],[955,958],[959,970],[971,973],[974,977],[978,982],[983,985],[986,989],[990,996],[997,1003],[1004,1009],[1009,1010],[1011,1014],[1015,1023],[1024,1028],[1029,1031],[1032,1035],[1036,1042],[1042,1043],[1044,1051],[1052,1056],[1057,1060],[1061,1065],[1065,1066],[1067,1071],[1072,1080],[1081,1083],[1084,1086],[1087,1095],[1096,1099],[1100,1104],[1105,1115],[1115,1116],[1117,1120],[1121,1125],[1126,1139],[1140,1145],[1146,1149],[1150,1154],[1155,1160],[1161,1163],[1164,1175],[1176,1179],[1180,1183],[1184,1191],[1192,1197],[1198,1200],[1201,1204],[1205,1210],[1211,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1225,1226],[1227,1232],[1233,1236],[1237,1240],[1241,1243],[1244,1247],[1248,1256],[1257,1263],[1264,1268],[1269,1277],[1278,1280],[1281,1286],[1287,1291],[1292,1296],[1297,1302],[1303,1306],[1307,1313],[1313,1314],[1315,1316],[1317,1324],[1325,1328],[1329,1340],[1341,1348],[1349,1353],[1354,1357],[1358,1362],[1363,1365],[1366,1370],[1371,1374],[1375,1381],[1382,1388],[1389,1393],[1394,1396],[1397,1400],[1401,1405],[1406,1408],[1409,1412],[1413,1419],[1419,1420]],"answers":["a new entrance building","new entrance building","a new entrance building"],"uuid":"5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca0-high-conf-turk3"},"2319":{"context":"Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, \"My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\"","question":"What reasons cause failure of the disobedience with authorities?","spans":[[0,4],[5,7],[8,11],[12,16],[17,26],[27,30],[31,41],[42,46],[47,52],[53,55],[56,61],[62,70],[71,85],[86,89],[90,97],[98,103],[104,108],[109,111],[112,117],[118,130],[131,136],[136,137],[138,141],[142,149],[149,150],[151,154],[155,162],[163,166],[167,171],[172,174],[175,181],[182,189],[190,192],[193,196],[197,199],[200,205],[206,207],[208,215],[216,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[238,239],[240,243],[244,251],[252,254],[255,258],[259,261],[262,266],[267,269],[270,276],[277,285],[285,286],[287,289],[290,292],[293,302],[303,309],[310,316],[317,320],[321,326],[327,336],[336,337],[338,341],[342,344],[345,350],[351,359],[360,366],[367,370],[371,379],[380,389],[389,390],[391,395],[396,397],[398,405],[405,407],[408,415],[416,418],[419,427],[428,441],[442,445],[446,451],[452,454],[455,461],[462,469],[469,470],[471,474],[475,478],[479,481],[482,489],[489,490],[491,498],[498,499],[500,504],[505,510],[511,523],[524,528],[529,540],[541,546],[547,549],[550,554],[555,557],[558,564],[565,575],[576,578],[579,592],[592,593],[594,603],[603,604],[605,614],[615,618],[619,621],[622,623],[624,628],[629,631],[632,645],[646,648],[649,652],[653,658],[659,672],[672,673],[674,676],[677,680],[681,683],[684,685],[686,690],[691,693],[694,701],[702,706],[706,707],[708,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,724],[725,737],[738,742],[743,745],[746,749],[750,753],[754,760],[761,763],[764,766],[767,778],[779,781],[782,786],[787,789],[790,800],[801,803],[804,807],[808,816],[816,817],[818,825],[826,831],[831,832],[833,834],[834,836],[837,842],[843,851],[851,852],[853,856],[857,860],[860,861],[861,869],[869,870],[871,873],[874,877],[878,882],[883,886],[887,888],[889,893],[894,896],[897,901],[902,906],[906,908],[908,911],[912,914],[915,917],[917,918],[919,924],[925,928],[928,929],[930,934],[935,938],[939,942],[943,946],[947,951],[952,961],[962,966],[967,968],[969,976],[976,978],[978,981],[982,984],[985,988],[989,1000],[1001,1007],[1008,1010],[1011,1013],[1014,1016],[1017,1022],[1023,1025],[1026,1029],[1030,1040],[1040,1041],[1042,1045],[1046,1051],[1052,1054],[1055,1059],[1060,1064],[1065,1069],[1070,1074],[1075,1077],[1078,1080],[1081,1084],[1085,1089],[1090,1092],[1093,1095],[1096,1103],[1104,1106],[1107,1110],[1111,1121],[1121,1122],[1123,1125],[1126,1128],[1129,1130],[1131,1134],[1134,1135],[1136,1141],[1142,1144],[1145,1147],[1148,1155],[1156,1158],[1159,1167],[1168,1175],[1176,1178],[1179,1183],[1184,1189],[1190,1192],[1192,1193],[1194,1197],[1198,1206],[1206,1207],[1208,1211],[1212,1216],[1217,1219],[1220,1223],[1224,1231],[1231,1232],[1233,1235],[1236,1237],[1238,1246],[1247,1250],[1251,1255],[1255,1256],[1256,1264],[1265,1268],[1268,1269],[1270,1272],[1273,1275],[1276,1277],[1278,1284],[1285,1288],[1289,1298],[1299,1301],[1302,1305],[1306,1311],[1311,1312],[1313,1316],[1317,1320],[1321,1323],[1324,1326],[1327,1330],[1331,1334],[1335,1339],[1340,1344],[1345,1356],[1357,1359],[1360,1363],[1364,1378],[1379,1386],[1387,1388],[1389,1394],[1395,1398],[1399,1403],[1404,1413],[1414,1421],[1422,1424],[1425,1431],[1432,1445],[1446,1450],[1451,1454],[1455,1461],[1461,1462],[1462,1463]],"answers":["lack of understanding of the legal ramifications,","a suspect's talking to criminal investigators","lack of understanding","lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude."],"uuid":"5728e8212ca10214002daa6f"},"1339":{"context":"The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth, and read from the creation story in the Book of Genesis, on Christmas Eve, 1968.
